        <p>In a profoundly enlightening and legally consequential judgment, the Orissa High Court has set a powerful precedent by emphatically holding that <strong>an Executive Magistrate is not empowered to record confessions for offences under the Essential Commodities Act, 1955</strong>.</p>
      </div>

      <p>This judgment, authored by Hon'ble Mr Justice Sashikanta Mishra, forming part of a Single Judge Bench at Cuttack, is remarkable not only for its doctrinal clarity but also for its unwavering commitment to constitutional procedure and due process. It sets aside the conviction and sentence imposed by the trial court on the accused persons, thereby reaffirming the fundamental principles of criminal jurisprudence.</p>

      <!-- Opening Observations -->
      <h2>📋 Opening Observations and Background</h2>
      
      <div class="para-card">
        <div class="para-number">Para 1</div>
        <p>The Hon'ble Bench commences the judgment by stating that the appeal arises from a conviction judgment dated <strong>23.12.1994</strong> passed by the learned Additional Sessions Judge-cum-Special Judge, Jajpur, in 2(a) CC Case No. 198 of 1984 / 6 of 1993. The accused was convicted under <span class="statute-highlight">Section 7 of the Essential Commodities Act</span> and sentenced to three months of Rigorous Imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 100, with a default sentence of one month RI. Originally, two appellants had challenged the conviction, but one – Paramananda Sahu – passed away during the pendency of the appeal, causing it to abate against him.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="para-card">
        <div class="para-number">Para 2</div>
        <p>The Court sets out the facts: the prosecution was initiated based on a report dated <strong>24.03.1984</strong> by the Inspector of Supplies (Regulatory), Cuttack, who discovered that M/s Minati Stores at Kuakhia had <strong>40.95 quintals of groundnut in the shell</strong> at two locations, which was not reflected in the stock records. The firm was allegedly operating beyond permissible limits and without a proper licence. It was also noted that no price or stock display board was found in the shop or godown. The alleged violations pertained to Clause 3 of the Orissa Declaration of Stocks and Prices of Essential Commodities Order, 1973.</p>
        <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">The deceased appellant Paramananda Sahu was stated to be the husband of the firm's partners and was allegedly involved in the transactions alongside co-accused Ananda Ch. Sahu. Based on these allegations, the trial court took cognizance of the offence.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- Trial Court Proceedings -->
      <h2>⚖️ Trial Court Proceedings and Conviction</h2>
      
      <div class="para-card">
        <div class="para-number">Para 3</div>
        <p>The Hon'ble Court notes that the accused persons pleaded denial to all charges.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="para-card">
        <div class="para-number">Para 4</div>
        <p>The prosecution examined two witnesses – <strong>P.W.1 (Executive Magistrate)</strong> and <strong>P.W.2 (complainant)</strong> – and relied on eight documents. In defence, three witnesses were examined.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="para-card">
        <div class="para-number">Para 5</div>
        <p>The trial court placed reliance on the seizure of the groundnut stock and the <strong>confessional statement of the accused Paramananda (marked as Exhibit 3)</strong> to convict both accused.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- Critical Scrutiny -->
      <h2>🔍 Critical Scrutiny of the Confession and Evidentiary Gaps</h2>
      
      <div class="para-card">
        <div class="para-number">Para 9</div>
        <p>The Court examines the nature and evidentiary value of <strong>Exhibit 3</strong>. P.W.1, the Executive Magistrate, admitted that the statement was written in his hand but <span class="evidence-flaw">not signed due to oversight</span>. Importantly, he also admitted to <span class="evidence-flaw">not giving any certificate that the statement had been read over and explained</span> to the accused. The trial court nonetheless treated it as a valid confession.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="para-card">
        <div class="para-number">Para 10</div>
        <p>The High Court questioned the admissibility of this so-called confession. The Bench observed that Exhibit 3 lacked any formal endorsement as to who recorded it. Though signed by the accused, <strong>there was no proof that the Executive Magistrate had the authority to record it</strong>, especially in light of his failure to even sign the document.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="evidence-box">
        <h4><i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> Fatal Flaws in Exhibit 3 (Confession)</h4>
        <ul style="margin-top: 1rem;">
          <li><span class="evidence-flaw">✗ Not signed</span> by the Executive Magistrate</li>
          <li><span class="evidence-flaw">✗ No certificate</span> that statement was read over and explained</li>
          <li><span class="evidence-flaw">✗ No formal endorsement</span> as to who recorded it</li>
          <li><span class="evidence-flaw">✗ Executive Magistrate lacked authority</span> to record confession</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <!-- Legal Framework -->
      <h2>📚 Legal Framework: Section 164 CrPC and EC Act</h2>
      
      <div class="para-card">
        <div class="para-number">Para 11</div>
        <p>The Court addressed whether the Executive Magistrate was empowered to record such a confession. <span class="statute-highlight">Section 10-A of the Essential Commodities Act</span> makes offences under the Act cognizable. <span class="statute-highlight">Section 11</span> stipulates that no court shall take cognizance unless a public servant, an aggrieved person, or a recognised consumer association files a written report. The Act itself does not lay down any specific procedural mechanism for trial or confession, bringing <span class="statute-highlight">Section 4 of the CrPC</span> into play.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="para-card">
        <div class="para-number">Para 12-13</div>
        <p><span class="statute-highlight">Section 4(2) of the CrPC</span> provides that offences under any other law must be tried in accordance with CrPC provisions unless that special law prescribes a different procedure. Since the Essential Commodities Act lacks such a provision, CrPC procedures apply, including those under <span class="statute-highlight">Section 164</span>, which governs confessions. Section 164 empowers <strong>only Judicial Magistrates</strong> to record confessions, and this applies even to offences under special legislations like the Essential Commodities Act, unless otherwise provided.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- Precedents -->
      <h2>📜 Legal Precedents and Analysis</h2>
      
      <div class="para-card">
        <div class="para-number">Para 14</div>
        <p>The Court referred to the landmark ruling in <strong>Asstt. CCE v. Duncan Agro Industries, (2000) 7 SCC 53</strong>, where the Supreme Court held that Section 164 CrPC applies only during investigations under Chapter XII of the Code and that confessions must be voluntary and made before an authorised Magistrate.</p>
        
        <div class="precedent-card">
          <i class="fas fa-gavel" style="color: #8b5cf6;"></i>
          <span class="precedent-citation">Asstt. CCE v. Duncan Agro Industries, (2000) 7 SCC 53</span>
        </div>
        
        <p>This position was reinforced by <strong>Mahavir v. State, (2001) 7 SCC 148</strong>, which clarified that non-confessional statements could not be recorded unless sponsored by the investigating officer.</p>
        
        <div class="precedent-card">
          <i class="fas fa-gavel" style="color: #8b5cf6;"></i>
          <span class="precedent-citation">Mahavir v. State, (2001) 7 SCC 148</span>
        </div>
      </div>
      
      <div class="para-card">
        <div class="para-number">Para 15</div>
        <p>The Court found <strong>no provision under which the Executive Magistrate (P.W.1) could record a confession</strong>. Without any statutory authority, Exhibit 3 was <strong>inadmissible in law</strong>. It could, at best, be treated as an extra-judicial confession, which would still need to be proved as voluntary – something the prosecution failed to establish. The confession, being the foundation of the trial court's verdict, rendered the judgment legally unsustainable.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- Lack of Linkage -->
      <h2>🔗 Lack of Linkage and Scanty Evidence</h2>
      
      <div class="para-card">
        <div class="para-number">Para 16</div>
        <p>The Court dissected the other evidence presented by the prosecution. Groundnuts were found in the houses of Madhab Sahoo and Raghunath Behera, <strong>not in the firm's shop</strong>. Crucially, no evidence linked the accused with these individuals or the groundnuts. As to the deceased appellant Paramananda Sahu, the prosecution failed to demonstrate his involvement beyond mere presence during the inspection. That alone was insufficient to establish guilt.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="para-card">
        <div class="para-number">Para 17</div>
        <p>The Court analyzed allegations that the accused operated without a licence or failed to display mandatory boards. The prosecution's case rested on entries in a stock register and some cash memos, which allegedly proved that more than 30 quintals of groundnuts were transacted. However, <strong>no evidence directly connected the accused to these transactions</strong>, nor were the items seized from the firm's premises. The Court held the evidence to be insufficient and speculative.</p>
