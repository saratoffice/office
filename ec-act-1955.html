    <h3>The Schedule</h3>
    <p>
        The Schedule lists the commodities declared as essential commodities under the Act.
    </p>


    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        The Constitution of India originally had 395 articles, 22 parts, and 8 schedules when it was adopted in 1950.
        However, these numbers have changed over time due to amendments. As of now, the Constitution consists of
        448 articles, 25 parts, 12 schedules, and 104 amendments.
    </p>

    <p>
        Article 246 deals with the distribution of legislative powers between the Union and the States and it explicitly
        refers to the three lists in the 7th Schedule.
    </p>

    <h3>The 7th Schedule is divided into three parts:</h3>

    <h4>1. Union List (List I):</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            This list contains subjects on which only the Union Government can legislate. These are matters of national
            importance, such as defense, foreign affairs, atomic energy, banking, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
            There are 100 items in this list (as per the original Constitution, though it has been amended over time).
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>2. State List (List II):</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            This list contains subjects on which only the State Governments can legislate. These are matters of local
            or regional importance, such as police, public health, agriculture, local government, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
            The State List originally contained 61 items (now reduced through amendments).
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>3. Concurrent List (List III):</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            This list includes subjects on which both the Union and State Governments can legislate. In case of a conflict,
            the law made by the Union Government prevails.
        </li>
        <li>
            There are 52 items in this list, such as education, marriage, trade unions, criminal law, etc.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        In the Concurrent list, there is one entry no. 33, which is related to the Essential Commodity Act.
    </p>

    <h3>Entry No. 33</h3>
    <p>
        Trade and commerce in, and the production, supply and distribution of,—
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>(a) the products of any industry where the control of such industry by the Union is declared by Parliament by law to be expedient in the public interest, and imported goods of the same kind as such products;</li>
        <li>(b) foodstuffs, including edible oilseeds and oils;</li>
        <li>(c) cattle fodder, including oilcakes and other concentrates;</li>
        <li>(d) raw cotton, whether ginned or unginned, and cotton seed; and</li>
        <li>(e) raw jute.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why Invoking the Act?</h2>
    <p>
        In 1955, India was facing a food shortage and relied on imports, like wheat from the US, to feed the population.
        To prevent prices from rising during the busy festival season, the government took steps to make sure there was
        enough food, especially pulses. These measures were meant to stop traders from creating an artificial scarcity—
        a situation where they limit supply on purpose to raise prices.
    </p>

    <h2>Historical Background of the Act</h2>
    <p>
        The Essential Commodities Act traces its origins to 1939, when the Government of India enacted rules under the
        Defence of India Act to regulate essential goods during World War II (1939 – 1945). In 1946, the Essential Supplies
        (Temporary Powers) Ordinance was introduced, later replaced by the Essential Supplies (Temporary Powers) Act, 1946.
        After India gained independence in 1947, the Act was further extended through two resolutions in 1948 and 1949.
    </p>

    <p>
        In 1955, the government passed the Essential Commodities Act, which replaced earlier legislation and provided
        permanent measures for regulating the production, supply, and distribution of essential goods. The Act came
        into force on April 1, 1955.
    </p>

    <h2>Scope of this Act</h2>
    <p>
        This Act extends to the whole of India. The Act was enacted to ensure the availability of essential commodities
        to consumers and protect them from the exploitation of unscrupulous traders.
    </p>

    <h2>The basic objective of this Act</h2>
    <p>There are two main aims:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>To prevent hoarding and black marketing of foodstuffs to maintain or increase the supply of these essential commodities, and</li>
        <li>To secure equitable distribution and availability of these essential commodities.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What happens when a commodity is declared essential?</h2>
    <p>The Act empowered the government to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Regulate the production, distribution, and supply of essential commodities.</li>
        <li>Impose stock limits, price controls, and distribution restrictions.</li>
        <li>Issue orders to prevent hoarding and black-marketing of essential goods.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Sections and Schedules in the Act</h2>
    <p>
        The Act comprises 16 main sections and 1 Schedule. The sections provide the framework for implementing control
        orders, and the Act includes one Schedule, listing the commodities subject to regulation.
    </p>

    <p>
        The Schedule lists the specific items deemed essential commodities (e.g., food grains, oils, medicines, fuels, etc.)
        which the government can control to ensure their availability and prevent scarcity, price hikes, or exploitation
        in the market.
    </p>

    <h2>Section 1 - Short title and extent</h2>
    <p>(1) This Act may be called the Essential Commodities Act, of 1955.</p>
    <p>(2) It extends to the whole of India.</p>

    <h2>Section 2 - Definitions</h2>
    <p><strong>(a) Collector:</strong> This term refers to the main officer in charge, but it can also include an Additional Collector or other officers, such as a Sub-Divisional Officer, who are authorized by the Collector to do the same work and use the same powers under this law.</p>

    <p><strong>(b) Food-crops:</strong> There is no specific definition of Food Crops. It is related to both humans and animals. This includes crops like sugarcane is in foodstuffs and tea is not a foodstuff.</p>

    <p><strong>(c) Notified order:</strong> This means an order that has been officially published in the government’s Official Gazette.</p>
    <p>a. Order: This includes any direction given under a Notified order.</p>

    <p><strong>(d) State Government:</strong> When referring to a Union Territory, this means the administrator of that territory.</p>

    <p><strong>(e) Sugar:</strong> This includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Any sugar that has more than 90% sucrose (including sugar candy).</li>
        <li>Khandasari sugar, bura sugar, crushed sugar, or any sugar in crystals or powdered form.</li>
        <li>Raw sugar is produced in a vacuum pan sugar factory.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Case Laws</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Satpal Gupta v. State of Haryana:</strong> Foodstuff is related to both humans and animals. In this case,
            it was established that cattle and poultry foods are included within the meaning of the ‘foodstuff.
            Therefore, it concludes that foodstuff is related to both humans and animals.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>State of Bombay v. Virkumar Gulab Chand Shah:</strong> Turmeric has been included in the scope of
            foodstuff. In this case, it was established that the foodstuff includes raw materials, things used in the
            process and things used in the preparation of food. Therefore, turmeric has been included in the scope of
            foodstuff.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>S. Samuel, M.D., Harrisons v. Union of India:</strong> Tea is not a foodstuff. In this case, it was
            decided that tea is not a foodstuff and merely a stimulant. It is neither used in the preparation of food nor
            contains any nutritional value, however in general parlance also when a person takes tea doesn’t consider it
            as having food.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Section 2A - Essential Commodities</h2>
    <p>
        (1) What is an Essential Commodity? An "essential commodity" is a product listed in the Schedule (a list in the law).
    </p>

    </p>

    <h2>Section 3 - Powers to Control Production, Supply, Distribution, etc.</h2>
    <p>
        The Powers to Control Production, Supply, and Distribution are conferred upon governments to regulate or control
        the production, supply, and distribution of essential goods.
    </p>

    <p>
        These powers help prevent hoarding, black marketing, and ensure equitable distribution during shortages or emergencies.
        Authorities can impose stock limits, licensing requirements, and price controls to safeguard public interest.
    </p>

    <h3>Section 3(1): Central Government's Power to Regulate or Prohibit Essential Commodities</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Purpose: If the Central Government believes that it is necessary to ensure a steady supply of essential commodities,
            to make sure these goods are available at fair prices, or to secure supplies for the defence of India,
            it can issue orders to regulate or ban the production, supply, and distribution of essential goods.
        </li>
        <li>This can include controlling trade and commerce in these goods.</li>
    </ul>

<h2>Section 3(2): Specific Powers the Government May Use</h2>

    <p>
        In addition to the powers in Subsection (1), the Central Government can make specific rules about essential
        commodities. These rules can include:
    </p>

    <h3>(a) Regulating Production</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The government can require licenses or permits for producing or manufacturing essential commodities
            (like food, medicine, etc.).
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>(b) Using Wasteland (Restricted) or Arable (Unused) Land for Farming</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The government can require that unused land be used to grow food crops. This helps to grow, maintain,
            and increase cultivation of any general or specific food crop.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>(c) Controlling Prices</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The government can control how much essential goods (like food and fuel) can be bought or sold for,
            to keep prices fair.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>(d) Regulating Storage and Distribution</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The government can regulate how goods are stored, transported, sold, and consumed.
        </li>
        <li>
            This may include requiring permits or licenses for these activities.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>(e) Preventing Hoarding</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The government can stop people or businesses from withholding essential goods that are typically for
            sale, to prevent shortages and unfair price hikes.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>(f) Selling to the Government</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            If someone is holding a stock of essential goods (or producing them), the government can require them
            to sell part or all of their stock to the government or government-controlled entities.
        </li>
        <li>
            The government can also specify how much a producer should sell, depending on the local supply and
            demand.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>(g) Regulating Harmful Transactions</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The government can restrict or stop certain business activities involving foodstuffs or essential
            commodities if it believes these activities might harm the public.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>(h) Collecting Information</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The government can require businesses to provide data and statistics related to the production,
            sale, and distribution of essential goods. This helps with effective regulation.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>(i) Record-Keeping and Licenses</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>(i) Record-Keeping and Inspections:</strong> The government can require people and businesses
            involved in essential goods to maintain records and books (like financial accounts) and allow
            inspectors to check them. They may also need to provide specific information when asked.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>(ii) Issuing Licenses and Permits:</strong> The government can issue licenses, permits, or
            other official documents for businesses and charge fees for these. A security deposit may also be
            required, which can be forfeited if license conditions are violated.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>(j) Search and Seizure</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>(i)</strong> Authorized officials (such as inspectors) can enter and search premises,
            vehicles, ships, or animals if they suspect a violation of the rules.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>(ii)</strong> If illegal goods or contraband are found, they can be seized.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>(iii)</strong> The government can also seize books, accounts, or documents relevant to legal
            proceedings. The business owner is allowed to take copies of these documents during inspection.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Section 3(3): Price Payments for Essential Commodities</h2>

    <p>
        If someone sells an essential commodity in compliance with a government order (such as selling stock to
        the government), the price payable will be determined as follows:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>(a) Agreed Price:</strong> If the buyer and seller mutually agree on a price that follows the
            controlled price rules, that agreed price will apply.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>(b) Controlled Price:</strong> If no agreement is possible, the controlled price (if fixed
            by the government) will apply.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>(c) Market Price:</strong> If no controlled price exists, the price will be based on the
            prevailing market rate at the time of sale.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Section 3(3A): Special Provisions for Foodstuffs</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>(i)</strong> If the Central Government considers it necessary to control rising prices or
            prevent hoarding of food in a particular area, it may issue a notification in the Official Gazette.
            This notification may regulate food prices even if it overrides earlier rules.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>(ii)</strong> Any such notification will remain valid for a period of up to three months, as
            specified in the notification.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>(iii)</strong> After the notification is issued, the price charged for the specified food
            will be:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>(a)</strong> The agreed price, provided it complies with any controlled price.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>(b)</strong> The controlled price, if no agreement can be reached and such a price
                    exists.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>(c)</strong> If neither applies, the average market rate of the food in that area
                    during the three months preceding the notification.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>(iv)</strong> An officer appointed by the Central Government will determine the average market
            rate based on prices in the concerned or nearby area. This determination will be final and cannot be
            challenged in court.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Section 3(3B): Compensation for Sale of Food Items to Government Without Notification</h2>

    <p>
        If a person is directed to sell foodgrains, edible oilseeds, or edible oils to the Central or State
        Government (or its officers, agents, or government-owned corporations), and no price notification exists
        or the notification has expired, a procurement price shall be paid.
    </p>

    <p>
        This procurement price is fixed by the State Government with prior approval of the Central Government,
        based on the following factors:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>(a)</strong> Any controlled price already fixed for the foodgrain, oilseed, or oil under this
            law or any other law.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>(b)</strong> The overall crop prospects.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>(c)</strong> The need to ensure availability of food to consumers at reasonable prices,
            particularly to vulnerable sections.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>(d)</strong> Recommendations of the Agricultural Prices Commission regarding the commodity.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Section 3(3C): Price Determination for Sugar Sale</h2>

    <p>
        Where a sugar producer is required by a government order to sell sugar to the Central or State Government
        or any other buyer, the price shall be determined by the Central Government, irrespective of whether a
        prior notification under Subsection (3A) exists.
    </p>

    <p>The price determination will take into account:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            The cost of producing sugar, including the cost of converting sugarcane into sugar and transporting
            it to the factory.
        </li>
        <li>
            A reasonable return or profit on the capital invested in the sugar business.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        The Central Government may fix different prices for different areas, factories, or categories of sugar.
    </p>

    <h3>Provisional Price Determination for Earlier Seasons</h3>
    <p>
        If the price of sugar produced up to the 2008–2009 season was fixed provisionally, the final price shall
        be determined according to the rules applicable before October 1, 2009.
    </p>


<h2>Section 3(D): Control Over Sale and Movement of Sugar</h2>
    <p>
        The Central Government can order that no producer, importer, or exporter of sugar can sell, give away,
        or move sugar from their factory's storage (whether inside or outside the factory) or the warehouses
        of importers or exporters, unless they follow specific government directions.
    </p>

    <h3>Exception</h3>
    <p>
        This rule does not apply if the sugar is pledged (used as collateral) by the producer or importer to a
        scheduled bank (a bank recognized by the Reserve Bank of India) or a similar bank.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, even in this case, the bank can sell the pledged sugar only with prior permission from the
        Central Government.
    </p>

    <h2>Section 3(4): Appointment of an Authorized Controller</h2>
    <p>
        If the Central Government believes that it is necessary to maintain or increase the production and
        supply of an essential commodity, it may issue an order appointing a person (called an authorized
        controller) to manage or supervise part or all of the operations of a business involved in producing
        or supplying that commodity.
    </p>

    <h3>Powers and Responsibilities of the Authorized Controller</h3>

    <h4>(a) Following Government Instructions</h4>
    <p>
        The authorized controller must perform duties in accordance with instructions issued by the Central
        Government. However, the controller cannot issue directions that conflict with existing laws or rules
        governing the management of the business, unless the government order explicitly permits such action.
    </p>

    <h4>(b) Managing the Business</h4>
    <p>
        The business, or the specified part of it, must be managed according to the directions given by the
        authorized controller. Any manager or person in charge of the business is required to comply with
        these directions.
    </p>

    <h2>Section 3(5): Notification of Orders</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>General Orders:</strong> If an order affects a large group of people, it must be published
            in the Official Gazette.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Orders to Individuals:</strong> If an order affects a specific person or business, it must
            be served directly. If direct service is not possible, it may be affixed to the premises, with
            certification by witnesses.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Section 3(6): Parliamentary Oversight</h2>
    <p>
        Every order issued by the government under this section must be laid before both Houses of Parliament
        after it is made, ensuring legislative scrutiny of executive action.
    </p>

    <h2>Section 4: Imposition of Duties on State Governments, etc.</h2>
    <p>
        Orders made under Section 3 may delegate powers and responsibilities to the Central Government,
        State Governments, or their officers. Such orders may also issue directions to these authorities
        regarding how they should exercise their powers or perform their duties.
    </p>
    <p>
        In simple terms, this section enables the government to instruct central or state authorities on
        how to regulate the production, supply, and distribution of essential commodities.
    </p>

    <h2>Section 5: Delegation of Powers</h2>
    <p>
        The Central Government may, by an official order, delegate powers conferred under Section 3 to:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Any officer or authority under the Central Government.</li>
        <li>State Governments or their officers.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        The order will clearly specify which powers are delegated and the conditions under which they may be exercised.
    </p>

    <h2>Section 6: Effect of Orders Inconsistent with Other Laws</h2>
    <p>
        Any order made under Section 3 will have overriding effect over any inconsistent provisions contained
        in other laws. Even if another law conflicts with such an order, the order under the Essential
        Commodities Act will prevail.
    </p>

    <h2>Section 6A: Confiscation of Essential Commodities</h2>

    <h3>(1) Seizure and Reporting</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            When essential commodities are seized under an order issued pursuant to Section 3, a report must
            be submitted without undue delay to the Collector.
        </li>
        <li>
            If the Collector is satisfied that the order has been violated, he may order:

                <li>Confiscation of the seized essential commodities.</li>
                <li>Confiscation of containers used to store the commodities.</li>

        Foodgrains or edible oilseeds seized from a producer cannot be confiscated if they are owned by the
        producer and intended for personal use.
    </p>

    <h4>Further Exception</h4>
    <p>
        Where transport vehicles, animals, or vessels are used for commercial carriage, the owner may pay
        a fine equal to the market price of the seized goods instead of confiscation.
    </p>

    <h3>(2) Sale of Seized Commodities</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            If the seized goods are perishable or if it is in the public interest, the Collector may:
            <ul>
                <li>Sell them at a controlled price, if such price exists.</li>
                <li>Sell them through public auction if no price is fixed.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>

            Central or State Government.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>(3) Disposal of Sale Proceeds</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>If confiscation is not ordered, the proceeds shall be returned to the owner.</li>
        <li>If a confiscation order is overturned on appeal, proceeds shall be returned to the owner.</li>
        <li>If the accused is acquitted, proceeds shall also be returned.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Section 6B: Issue of Show Cause Notice before Confiscation</h2>
    <p>
        No confiscation order shall be passed without giving the concerned person a written notice explaining
        the grounds of proposed confiscation and allowing them an opportunity to submit a written explanation.
    </p>

    <h2>Section 6C: Appeal Against Confiscation Order</h2>
    <p>
        Any person aggrieved by a confiscation order may appeal within one month to the District and Sessions
        Judge appointed by the State Government.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The authority may confirm, modify, or annul the confiscation order.</li>
        <li>
            If goods cannot be returned due to modification, annulment, or acquittal, compensation shall be
            paid along with reasonable interest from the date of seizure.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Price Determination for Compensation</h3>

    </ul>

    <h2>Section 6D: Confiscation Not to Bar Other Punishments</h2>
    <p>
        Confiscation of goods does not prevent the imposition of other penalties, including imprisonment or fines
        under Section 7.
    </p>

    <h2>Section 6E: Bar of Jurisdiction in Certain Cases</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The Collector or State Government alone has authority over seized goods pending confiscation.</li>
        <li>No other court or authority may interfere regarding possession, disposal, or release of such goods.</li>
        <li>This rule applies notwithstanding anything contained in any other law.</li>
    </ul>

        <li>
            <strong>Abetment:</strong> If a person encourages, assists, or incites another person to violate
            the order (known as abetting), they will also be treated as having violated the order themselves.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p><strong>Consequence:</strong></p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Deemed to Have Contravened:</strong> Both the person attempting the violation and the one
            abetting it will be deemed to have contravened the order, meaning they can be held legally
            responsible and face penalties, as if they had fully violated the order.
        </li>
    </ul>

<h2>Section 9 - False Statement:</h2>

    <p>If a person:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Gives false information when they are required to provide information or make a statement under
            any order made under Section 3 of the Act, and they know or have reasonable cause to believe that
            the information is false, or they do not believe it to be true, or
        </li>
        <li>
            Records a false statement in any book, account, record, declaration, return, or any other
            document they are required to maintain or submit under the Act,
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>Then, that person can be punished with:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Imprisonment for up to five years, or</li>
        <li>A fine, or</li>
        <li>Both imprisonment and fine.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Section 10 - Offences by Companies:</h2>

    <p><strong>(1)</strong> If a company breaks the law (violates an order under Section 3 of the Act):</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Every person who was in charge of, and responsible for, running the company at the time the
            violation happened will also be considered guilty of the offence.
        </li>
        <li>
            This means that both the company and the responsible individuals can be punished.
        </li>
        <li>
            However, if the person in charge can prove that the violation happened without their knowledge,
            or that they did everything possible to prevent it, they won’t be punished.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>(2)</strong> If the violation was caused by a director or other officer of the company:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            If it can be proven that the violation happened because of the approval, help, or negligence of
            any director, manager, or other officer of the company, that person will also be guilty and can
            be punished as well.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Section 10A - Offences to be Cognizable:</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>
            This section means that any offence under the Essential Commodities Act is a cognizable offence.
        </li>
        <li>
            In simple terms, a cognizable offence is one where the police can arrest the person without a
            warrant and start an investigation without permission from a court.
        </li>
        <li>
            So, if someone breaks the law under this Act, the police have the authority to take action
            immediately, arrest the person, and investigate the offence without needing to get a court
            order first.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Section 10B - Power of Court to Publish Information About Convicted Companies:</h2>

    <p><strong>(1)</strong> When a company is convicted under this Act, the court has the power to make public
        certain details about the company, such as:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>The company’s name and place of business,</li>
        <li>The nature of the offence (what the company did wrong),</li>
        <li>The fact that the company has been convicted,</li>
        <li>And any other details the court thinks are important.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        This information will be published at the company’s expense, in newspapers or in any other way the
        court decides.
    </p>

    <p><strong>(2)</strong> However, the court can’t publish this information until:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>The time for the company to appeal the court’s decision has passed, or</li>
        <li>If an appeal is made, it has been decided.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>(3)</strong> The cost of publishing this information will be charged to the company as if it
        were a fine imposed by the court.</p>

    <h2>Section 10C - Presumption of Culpable Mental State:</h2>

    <p><strong>(1)</strong> In any case where a person is being prosecuted for an offence under the Essential
        Commodities Act that requires a "culpable mental state" (meaning the person must have had a guilty
        mind, such as knowing they were breaking the law or intending to do something wrong), the court will
        assume that the person had that mental state.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            However, the accused person can defend themselves by proving that they did not have that guilty
            mind when committing the act.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>(2)</strong> What does "culpable mental state" mean?</p>

    <ul>
        <li>It includes things like:</li>
        <li>Intention (they meant to break the law),</li>
        <li>Motive (the reason they did it),</li>
        <li>Knowledge of the fact (they knew something was true that made the act wrong),</li>
        <li>Belief or reason to believe in something that makes the act unlawful.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>(3)</strong> In court, a fact is considered proven only if the judge is completely convinced
        (beyond a reasonable doubt), not just if it seems likely or probable.</p>

    <h2>Section 11: Cognizance of Offences</h2>
    <p>
        No court shall take cognizance of any offence punishable under this Act except upon a report in
        writing of the facts constituting such offence, made by:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            A public servant as defined under Section 21 of the Indian Penal Code; or
        </li>
        <li>
            Any person aggrieved by the offence; or
        </li>
        <li>
            A recognised consumer association, whether or not the person making the report is a member of
            such association.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Who is a Public Servant?</h3>
    <p>
        As per Section 21 of the Indian Penal Code, a public servant includes:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Judges;</li>
        <li>Government officers;</li>
        <li>Police officers;</li>
        <li>Municipal employees;</li>
        <li>Other persons performing official duties on behalf of the government.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Recognised Consumer Association</h3>
    <p>
        A recognised consumer association must be:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>A voluntary association; and</li>
        <li>
            Registered under the Companies Act, 1956, or any other corresponding law for the time being in force.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Examples include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Consumer guidance societies;</li>
        <li>Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) working in the field of consumer rights.</li>
    </ul>
<h2>Section 12: Special Provision Regarding Fine</h2>
    <p>
        Notwithstanding anything contained in Section 29 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, which places
        limits on the amount of fine that can be imposed by a Magistrate, this section empowers certain
        Magistrates to impose a fine exceeding ₹5,000 for contravention of an order made under Section 3 of
        the Essential Commodities Act.
    </p>
    <p>This power may be exercised by:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A Metropolitan Magistrate; or</li>
        <li>
            A Judicial Magistrate of the First Class who has been specially empowered by the State Government
            for this purpose.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Section 12A: Power to Try Summarily</h2>

    <h3>(1) Summary Trial</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            If the Central Government considers it necessary to ensure speedy disposal of cases relating to
            contraventions of orders under Section 3, it may issue a notification in the Official Gazette.
        </li>
        <li>
            Such notification shall declare certain orders as “special orders” for the purpose of summary
            trial.
        </li>
        <li>
            A summary trial involves a faster and simplified procedure, generally used for less serious
            offences.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>(2) Notification and Duration</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The notification will specify which orders are to be tried summarily.
        </li>
        <li>
            The notification remains in force for a period of two years unless cancelled earlier.
        </li>
        <li>
            On expiry or cancellation of the notification, cases already instituted shall continue to be
            tried summarily.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>(3) Authorities Competent to Conduct Summary Trials</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Judicial Magistrates of the First Class or Metropolitan Magistrates specially empowered by the
            State Government may conduct summary trials.
        </li>
        <li>
            The trial shall follow the procedure laid down in Sections 262 to 265 of the Code of Criminal
            Procedure, 1973.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>(4) Punishment in Summary Trials</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The maximum sentence that may be imposed in a summary trial is:
            <ul>
                <li>Imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year; or</li>
                <li>A fine not exceeding ₹5,000; or</li>
                <li>Both imprisonment and fine.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            If the Magistrate considers that the nature of the case warrants a more severe punishment, the
            case may be converted into a regular trial.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>(5) Restriction on Appeals</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            No appeal shall lie where the sentence imposed is:
            <ul>
                <li>Imprisonment for a term not exceeding one month; and</li>
                <li>A fine not exceeding ₹2,000.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Appeals are permitted if the punishment exceeds the above limits.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>(6) Pending Cases</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Cases pending at the time of commencement of this provision or issuance of notification, where
            no witnesses have been examined, shall be tried summarily.
        </li>
        <li>
            If such a case is pending before a Magistrate not empowered to conduct summary trials, it shall
            be transferred to a competent Magistrate.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Section 12B: Grant of Injunction by Civil Courts</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            No civil court shall grant an injunction or interim relief restraining any action taken or
            intended to be taken by:
            <ul>
                <li>The Central Government,</li>
                <li>The State Government, or</li>
                <li>Any public officer</li>
            </ul>
            under this Act.
        </li>
        <li>
            Such injunction may be sought only after giving prior notice to the concerned Government or
            officer.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Section 13: Presumption as to Orders</h2>

    <h3>Meaning and Scope</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            When an order is produced before a court, it shall be presumed that the order was duly made by
            the competent authority under the powers conferred by this Act.
        </li>
        <li>
            If an order appears to be signed and issued by an authority empowered under the Act, the court
            shall presume that it was validly made and properly executed.
        </li>
        <li>
            The court will assume that the order complies with all legal requirements and procedures.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Indian Evidence Act, 1872</h3>
    <p>
        This presumption is based on Section 114 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, which allows courts to
        presume the existence of certain facts unless disproved.
    </p>

    <h3>Burden of Proof</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The burden of proof lies on the person challenging the order.
        </li>
        <li>
            The challenger must prove that the order was not issued by a competent authority or was issued
            improperly.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Illustration</h3>
    <p>
        If a government officer issues an order under this Act and it is challenged in court, the court will
        presume that the officer acted lawfully and within authority unless evidence proves otherwise.
    </p>

    <h2>Section 14: Burden of Proof in Certain Cases</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Where a person is accused of contravening an order under Section 3 by doing an act without a
            permit, license, or authority, the burden lies on the accused to prove that such authority existed.
        </li>
        <li>
            This is an exception to the general rule of criminal law, where the prosecution normally bears
            the burden of proving guilt.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Section 15: Protection of Action Taken Under the Act</h2>

    <h3>(1) Protection of Individuals</h3>
    <p>
        No suit, prosecution, or other legal proceeding shall lie against any person for anything done in
        good faith in pursuance of an order made under Section 3.
    </p>

    <h3>(2) Protection of Government</h3>
    <p>
        No legal proceeding shall lie against the Government for any damage caused by actions taken in good
        faith under this Act.
    </p>

    <h2>Section 15A: Prosecution of Public Servants</h2>
    <p>
        No court shall take cognizance of an offence alleged to have been committed by a public servant while
        acting or purporting to act in discharge of official duties under Section 3, except with prior
        sanction:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            From the Central Government, where the public servant is employed under the Union Government; or
        </li>
        <li>
            From the State Government, where the public servant is employed under the State Government.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Legal Implications</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Encourages effective enforcement of the Act.</li>
        <li>Protects officials from harassment for actions taken honestly.</li>
        <li>
            Protection applies only when actions are taken in good faith and within lawful authority.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Illustrative Example</h3>
    <p>
        If a Civil Supplies Officer seizes wheat stock believing it violates a Section 3 order, and later it
        is found that the trader had a valid permit, the officer cannot be sued or prosecuted provided the
        action was taken honestly and within official powers.
    </p>
<h2>Section 16: Repeals and Savings</h2>

    <h3>(1) Repeals</h3>
    <p>The following laws are repealed:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>(a)</strong> The Essential Commodities Ordinance, 1955.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>(b)</strong> Any other law in force in any State, prior to the commencement of this Act,
            which provided for the control of production, supply, distribution, or trade and commerce in
            essential commodities.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>(2) Savings</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Despite the repeal of the above laws, any orders, licenses, permits, or appointments made under
            such repealed laws before the commencement of this Act shall continue to be valid.
        </li>
        <li>
            Such orders, licenses, permits, or appointments shall be deemed to have been made under this Act
            and shall remain in force until they are replaced by new orders, licenses, permits, or
            appointments issued under this Act.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>(3) Application of the General Clauses Act, 1897</h3>
    <p>
        The repeal mentioned in this section shall be subject to the provisions of Section 6 of the General
        Clauses Act, 1897. These provisions shall apply as if the repealed enactments were Acts of Parliament.
    </p>

    

    <h2>Landmark Judgments under the Essential Commodities Act</h2>

    <h3>1. Nathu Lal v. State of Madhya Pradesh (AIR 1966 SC 43)</h3>

    <h4>Facts</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The appellant, Nathu Lal, was a foodgrain dealer in Dhar, Madhya Pradesh.
        </li>
        <li>
            He was found storing 885 maunds and 2¼ seers of wheat without a license, as required under
            Section 7 of the Essential Commodities Act, 1955.
        </li>
        <li>
            He claimed that he had applied for the required license and believed it would be issued soon,
            based on assurances from government authorities.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Held</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The Supreme Court held that <strong>mens rea</strong> (guilty intention) is an essential element
            for proving an offence under Section 7 of the Act.
        </li>
        <li>
            The Court observed that merely because the Act is a welfare legislation, the requirement of
            intention cannot be ignored.
        </li>
        <li>
            The objective of the Act would not be defeated by insisting on proof of intention.
        </li>
        <li>
            Since Nathu Lal lacked guilty intent, he was not punished despite a technical violation of the law.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. State of Madhya Pradesh v. Narayan Singh &amp; Others (AIR 1989 SC 1789)</h3>

    <h4>Facts</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The respondents were truck drivers, cleaners, and helpers.
        </li>
        <li>
            They were caught transporting fertilizer bags from Indore to Maharashtra without a permit, as
            required under the Fertilizers (Movement Control) Order, 1973.
        </li>
        <li>
            Although they possessed invoices, they did not have the necessary permits and claimed ignorance
            of the permit requirement and the nature of the goods.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Held</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Section 7 of the Essential Commodities Act was amended in 1967 to include the words
            <em>“whether knowingly, intentionally, or otherwise.”</em>
        </li>
        <li>
            This amendment introduced the principle of <strong>strict liability</strong>, where intent or
            knowledge is not always required to establish guilt.
        </li>
        <li>
            However, the Supreme Court found that the prosecution failed to establish wrongful intention
            or negligence on the part of the respondents.
        </li>
        <li>
            As a result, no punishment was imposed.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The Essential Commodities Act, 1955 is a crucial legislation designed to safeguard public interest
            by regulating the production, supply, and pricing of essential commodities.
        </li>
        <li>
            The Act grants wide powers to the Central Government to ensure equitable distribution and prevent
            hoarding and black-marketing.
        </li>
        <li>
            Earlier judicial decisions emphasized the requirement of <strong>mens rea</strong>, but later
            amendments introduced strict liability for certain offences.
        </li>
        <li>
            Nevertheless, courts continue to insist on clear and convincing evidence before recording a
            conviction under the Act.
        </li>
    </ul>
