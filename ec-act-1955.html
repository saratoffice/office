    <h3>The Schedule</h3>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        The Constitution of India originally had 395 articles, 22 parts, and 8 schedules when it was adopted in 1950.
        However, these numbers have changed over time due to amendments. As of now, the Constitution consists of
        448 articles, 25 parts, 12 schedules, and 104 amendments.
    </p>

    <p>
        Article 246 deals with the distribution of legislative powers between the Union and the States and it explicitly
        refers to the three lists in the 7th Schedule.
    </p>

    <h3>The 7th Schedule is divided into three parts:</h3>

    <h4>1. Union List (List I):</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            This list contains subjects on which only the Union Government can legislate. These are matters of national
            importance, such as defense, foreign affairs, atomic energy, banking, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
            There are 100 items in this list (as per the original Constitution, though it has been amended over time).
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>2. State List (List II):</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            This list contains subjects on which only the State Governments can legislate. These are matters of local
            or regional importance, such as police, public health, agriculture, local government, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
            The State List originally contained 61 items (now reduced through amendments).
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>3. Concurrent List (List III):</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            This list includes subjects on which both the Union and State Governments can legislate. In case of a conflict,
            the law made by the Union Government prevails.
        </li>
        <li>
            There are 52 items in this list, such as education, marriage, trade unions, criminal law, etc.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        In the Concurrent list, there is one entry no. 33, which is related to the Essential Commodity Act.
    </p>

    <h3>Entry No. 33</h3>
    <p>
        Trade and commerce in, and the production, supply and distribution of,—
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>(a) the products of any industry where the control of such industry by the Union is declared by Parliament by law to be expedient in the public interest, and imported goods of the same kind as such products;</li>
        <li>(b) foodstuffs, including edible oilseeds and oils;</li>
        <li>(c) cattle fodder, including oilcakes and other concentrates;</li>
        <li>(d) raw cotton, whether ginned or unginned, and cotton seed; and</li>
        <li>(e) raw jute.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why Invoking the Act?</h2>
    <p>
        In 1955, India was facing a food shortage and relied on imports, like wheat from the US, to feed the population.
        To prevent prices from rising during the busy festival season, the government took steps to make sure there was
        enough food, especially pulses. These measures were meant to stop traders from creating an artificial scarcity—
        a situation where they limit supply on purpose to raise prices.
    </p>

    <h2>Historical Background of the Act</h2>
    <p>
        The Essential Commodities Act traces its origins to 1939, when the Government of India enacted rules under the
        Defence of India Act to regulate essential goods during World War II (1939 – 1945). In 1946, the Essential Supplies
        (Temporary Powers) Ordinance was introduced, later replaced by the Essential Supplies (Temporary Powers) Act, 1946.
        After India gained independence in 1947, the Act was further extended through two resolutions in 1948 and 1949.
    </p>

    <p>
        In 1955, the government passed the Essential Commodities Act, which replaced earlier legislation and provided
        permanent measures for regulating the production, supply, and distribution of essential goods. The Act came
        into force on April 1, 1955.
    </p>

    <h2>Scope of this Act</h2>
    <p>
        This Act extends to the whole of India. The Act was enacted to ensure the availability of essential commodities
        to consumers and protect them from the exploitation of unscrupulous traders.
    </p>

    <h2>The basic objective of this Act</h2>
    <p>There are two main aims:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>To prevent hoarding and black marketing of foodstuffs to maintain or increase the supply of these essential commodities, and</li>
        <li>To secure equitable distribution and availability of these essential commodities.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What happens when a commodity is declared essential?</h2>
    <p>The Act empowered the government to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Regulate the production, distribution, and supply of essential commodities.</li>
        <li>Impose stock limits, price controls, and distribution restrictions.</li>
        <li>Issue orders to prevent hoarding and black-marketing of essential goods.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Sections and Schedules in the Act</h2>
    <p>
        The Act comprises 16 main sections and 1 Schedule. The sections provide the framework for implementing control
        orders, and the Act includes one Schedule, listing the commodities subject to regulation.
    </p>

    <p>
        The Schedule lists the specific items deemed essential commodities (e.g., food grains, oils, medicines, fuels, etc.)
        which the government can control to ensure their availability and prevent scarcity, price hikes, or exploitation
        in the market.
    </p>

    <h2>Section 1 - Short title and extent</h2>
    <p>(1) This Act may be called the Essential Commodities Act, of 1955.</p>
    <p>(2) It extends to the whole of India.</p>

    <h2>Section 2 - Definitions</h2>
    <p><strong>(a) Collector:</strong> This term refers to the main officer in charge, but it can also include an Additional Collector or other officers, such as a Sub-Divisional Officer, who are authorized by the Collector to do the same work and use the same powers under this law.</p>

    <p><strong>(b) Food-crops:</strong> There is no specific definition of Food Crops. It is related to both humans and animals. This includes crops like sugarcane is in foodstuffs and tea is not a foodstuff.</p>

    <p><strong>(c) Notified order:</strong> This means an order that has been officially published in the government’s Official Gazette.</p>
    <p>a. Order: This includes any direction given under a Notified order.</p>

    <p><strong>(d) State Government:</strong> When referring to a Union Territory, this means the administrator of that territory.</p>

    <p><strong>(e) Sugar:</strong> This includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Any sugar that has more than 90% sucrose (including sugar candy).</li>
        <li>Khandasari sugar, bura sugar, crushed sugar, or any sugar in crystals or powdered form.</li>
        <li>Raw sugar is produced in a vacuum pan sugar factory.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Case Laws</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Satpal Gupta v. State of Haryana:</strong> Foodstuff is related to both humans and animals. In this case,
            it was established that cattle and poultry foods are included within the meaning of the ‘foodstuff.
            Therefore, it concludes that foodstuff is related to both humans and animals.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>State of Bombay v. Virkumar Gulab Chand Shah:</strong> Turmeric has been included in the scope of
            foodstuff. In this case, it was established that the foodstuff includes raw materials, things used in the
            process and things used in the preparation of food. Therefore, turmeric has been included in the scope of
            foodstuff.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>S. Samuel, M.D., Harrisons v. Union of India:</strong> Tea is not a foodstuff. In this case, it was
            decided that tea is not a foodstuff and merely a stimulant. It is neither used in the preparation of food nor
            contains any nutritional value, however in general parlance also when a person takes tea doesn’t consider it
            as having food.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Section 2A - Essential Commodities</h2>
    <p>
        (1) What is an Essential Commodity? An "essential commodity" is a product listed in the Schedule (a list in the law).

            to make sure these goods are available at fair prices, or to secure supplies for the defence of India,
            it can issue orders to regulate or ban the production, supply, and distribution of essential goods.

<h2>Section 3(2): Specific Powers the Government May Use</h2>

    <p>
        In addition to the powers in Subsection (1), the Central Government can make specific rules about essential
        commodities. These rules can include:
    </p>

    <h3>(a) Regulating Production</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The government can require licenses or permits for producing or manufacturing essential commodities
            (like food, medicine, etc.).
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>(b) Using Wasteland (Restricted) or Arable (Unused) Land for Farming</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The government can require that unused land be used to grow food crops. This helps to grow, maintain,
            and increase cultivation of any general or specific food crop.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>(c) Controlling Prices</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The government can control how much essential goods (like food and fuel) can be bought or sold for,
            to keep prices fair.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>(d) Regulating Storage and Distribution</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The government can regulate how goods are stored, transported, sold, and consumed.
        </li>
        <li>
            This may include requiring permits or licenses for these activities.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>(e) Preventing Hoarding</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The government can stop people or businesses from withholding essential goods that are typically for
            sale, to prevent shortages and unfair price hikes.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>(f) Selling to the Government</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            If someone is holding a stock of essential goods (or producing them), the government can require them
            to sell part or all of their stock to the government or government-controlled entities.
        </li>
        <li>
            The government can also specify how much a producer should sell, depending on the local supply and
            demand.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>(g) Regulating Harmful Transactions</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The government can restrict or stop certain business activities involving foodstuffs or essential
            commodities if it believes these activities might harm the public.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>(h) Collecting Information</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The government can require businesses to provide data and statistics related to the production,
            sale, and distribution of essential goods. This helps with effective regulation.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>(i) Record-Keeping and Licenses</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>(i) Record-Keeping and Inspections:</strong> The government can require people and businesses
            involved in essential goods to maintain records and books (like financial accounts) and allow
            inspectors to check them. They may also need to provide specific information when asked.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>(ii) Issuing Licenses and Permits:</strong> The government can issue licenses, permits, or
            other official documents for businesses and charge fees for these. A security deposit may also be
            required, which can be forfeited if license conditions are violated.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>(j) Search and Seizure</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>(i)</strong> Authorized officials (such as inspectors) can enter and search premises,
            vehicles, ships, or animals if they suspect a violation of the rules.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>(ii)</strong> If illegal goods or contraband are found, they can be seized.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>(iii)</strong> The government can also seize books, accounts, or documents relevant to legal
            proceedings. The business owner is allowed to take copies of these documents during inspection.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Section 3(3): Price Payments for Essential Commodities</h2>

    <p>
        If someone sells an essential commodity in compliance with a government order (such as selling stock to
        the government), the price payable will be determined as follows:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>(a) Agreed Price:</strong> If the buyer and seller mutually agree on a price that follows the
            controlled price rules, that agreed price will apply.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>(b) Controlled Price:</strong> If no agreement is possible, the controlled price (if fixed
            by the government) will apply.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>(c) Market Price:</strong> If no controlled price exists, the price will be based on the
            prevailing market rate at the time of sale.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Section 3(3A): Special Provisions for Foodstuffs</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>(i)</strong> If the Central Government considers it necessary to control rising prices or
            prevent hoarding of food in a particular area, it may issue a notification in the Official Gazette.
            This notification may regulate food prices even if it overrides earlier rules.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>(ii)</strong> Any such notification will remain valid for a period of up to three months, as

            will be:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>(a)</strong> The agreed price, provided it complies with any controlled price.

                    exists.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>(c)</strong> If neither applies, the average market rate of the food in that area
                    during the three months preceding the notification.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>(iv)</strong> An officer appointed by the Central Government will determine the average market
            rate based on prices in the concerned or nearby area. This determination will be final and cannot be
            challenged in court.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Section 3(3B): Compensation for Sale of Food Items to Government Without Notification</h2>

    <p>
        If a person is directed to sell foodgrains, edible oilseeds, or edible oils to the Central or State
        Government (or its officers, agents, or government-owned corporations), and no price notification exists
        or the notification has expired, a procurement price shall be paid.
    </p>

    <p>
        This procurement price is fixed by the State Government with prior approval of the Central Government,
        based on the following factors:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>(a)</strong> Any controlled price already fixed for the foodgrain, oilseed, or oil under this
            law or any other law.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>(b)</strong> The overall crop prospects.
        </li>
        <li>

            particularly to vulnerable sections.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>(d)</strong> Recommendations of the Agricultural Prices Commission regarding the commodity.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Section 3(3C): Price Determination for Sugar Sale</h2>

    <p>
        Where a sugar producer is required by a government order to sell sugar to the Central or State Government
        or any other buyer, the price shall be determined by the Central Government, irrespective of whether a
        prior notification under Subsection (3A) exists.
    </p>

    <p>The price determination will take into account:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            The cost of producing sugar, including the cost of converting sugarcane into sugar and transporting
            it to the factory.
        </li>
        <li>
            A reasonable return or profit on the capital invested in the sugar business.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        The Central Government may fix different prices for different areas, factories, or categories of sugar.
    </p>

    <h3>Provisional Price Determination for Earlier Seasons</h3>
    <p>
        If the price of sugar produced up to the 2008–2009 season was fixed provisionally, the final price shall
        be determined according to the rules applicable before October 1, 2009.
    </p>


<h2>Section 3(D): Control Over Sale and Movement of Sugar</h2>
    <p>
        The Central Government can order that no producer, importer, or exporter of sugar can sell, give away,
        or move sugar from their factory's storage (whether inside or outside the factory) or the warehouses
        of importers or exporters, unless they follow specific government directions.
    </p>

    <h3>Exception</h3>
    <p>
        This rule does not apply if the sugar is pledged (used as collateral) by the producer or importer to a
        scheduled bank (a bank recognized by the Reserve Bank of India) or a similar bank.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, even in this case, the bank can sell the pledged sugar only with prior permission from the
        Central Government.
    </p>

    <h2>Section 3(4): Appointment of an Authorized Controller</h2>
    <p>
        If the Central Government believes that it is necessary to maintain or increase the production and
        supply of an essential commodity, it may issue an order appointing a person (called an authorized
        controller) to manage or supervise part or all of the operations of a business involved in producing
        or supplying that commodity.
    </p>

    <h3>Powers and Responsibilities of the Authorized Controller</h3>

    <h4>(a) Following Government Instructions</h4>
    <p>
        The authorized controller must perform duties in accordance with instructions issued by the Central
        Government. However, the controller cannot issue directions that conflict with existing laws or rules
        governing the management of the business, unless the government order explicitly permits such action.
    </p>

    <h4>(b) Managing the Business</h4>
    <p>
        The business, or the specified part of it, must be managed according to the directions given by the
        authorized controller. Any manager or person in charge of the business is required to comply with
        these directions.
    </p>

    <h2>Section 3(5): Notification of Orders</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>

            in the Official Gazette.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Orders to Individuals:</strong> If an order affects a specific person or business, it must
            be served directly. If direct service is not possible, it may be affixed to the premises, with
            certification by witnesses.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Section 3(6): Parliamentary Oversight</h2>
    <p>
        Every order issued by the government under this section must be laid before both Houses of Parliament

    </p>

    <h2>Section 4: Imposition of Duties on State Governments, etc.</h2>
    <p>
        Orders made under Section 3 may delegate powers and responsibilities to the Central Government,
        State Governments, or their officers. Such orders may also issue directions to these authorities
        regarding how they should exercise their powers or perform their duties.
    </p>
    <p>
        In simple terms, this section enables the government to instruct central or state authorities on
        how to regulate the production, supply, and distribution of essential commodities.
    </p>

    <h2>Section 5: Delegation of Powers</h2>
    <p>
        The Central Government may, by an official order, delegate powers conferred under Section 3 to:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Any officer or authority under the Central Government.</li>
        <li>State Governments or their officers.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        The order will clearly specify which powers are delegated and the conditions under which they may be exercised.
    </p>

    <h2>Section 6: Effect of Orders Inconsistent with Other Laws</h2>
    <p>
        Any order made under Section 3 will have overriding effect over any inconsistent provisions contained
        in other laws. Even if another law conflicts with such an order, the order under the Essential
        Commodities Act will prevail.
    </p>
