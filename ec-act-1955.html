    <h3>The Schedule</h3>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        The Constitution of India originally had 395 articles, 22 parts, and 8 schedules when it was adopted in 1950.
        However, these numbers have changed over time due to amendments. As of now, the Constitution consists of
        448 articles, 25 parts, 12 schedules, and 104 amendments.
    </p>

    <p>
        Article 246 deals with the distribution of legislative powers between the Union and the States and it explicitly
        refers to the three lists in the 7th Schedule.
    </p>

    <h3>The 7th Schedule is divided into three parts:</h3>

    <h4>1. Union List (List I):</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            This list contains subjects on which only the Union Government can legislate. These are matters of national
            importance, such as defense, foreign affairs, atomic energy, banking, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
            There are 100 items in this list (as per the original Constitution, though it has been amended over time).
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>2. State List (List II):</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            This list contains subjects on which only the State Governments can legislate. These are matters of local
            or regional importance, such as police, public health, agriculture, local government, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
            The State List originally contained 61 items (now reduced through amendments).
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>3. Concurrent List (List III):</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            This list includes subjects on which both the Union and State Governments can legislate. In case of a conflict,
            the law made by the Union Government prevails.
        </li>
        <li>
            There are 52 items in this list, such as education, marriage, trade unions, criminal law, etc.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        In the Concurrent list, there is one entry no. 33, which is related to the Essential Commodity Act.
    </p>

    <h3>Entry No. 33</h3>
    <p>
        Trade and commerce in, and the production, supply and distribution of,—
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>(a) the products of any industry where the control of such industry by the Union is declared by Parliament by law to be expedient in the public interest, and imported goods of the same kind as such products;</li>
        <li>(b) foodstuffs, including edible oilseeds and oils;</li>
        <li>(c) cattle fodder, including oilcakes and other concentrates;</li>
        <li>(d) raw cotton, whether ginned or unginned, and cotton seed; and</li>
        <li>(e) raw jute.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why Invoking the Act?</h2>
    <p>
        In 1955, India was facing a food shortage and relied on imports, like wheat from the US, to feed the population.
        To prevent prices from rising during the busy festival season, the government took steps to make sure there was
        enough food, especially pulses. These measures were meant to stop traders from creating an artificial scarcity—
        a situation where they limit supply on purpose to raise prices.
    </p>

    <h2>Historical Background of the Act</h2>
    <p>
        The Essential Commodities Act traces its origins to 1939, when the Government of India enacted rules under the
        Defence of India Act to regulate essential goods during World War II (1939 – 1945). In 1946, the Essential Supplies
        (Temporary Powers) Ordinance was introduced, later replaced by the Essential Supplies (Temporary Powers) Act, 1946.
        After India gained independence in 1947, the Act was further extended through two resolutions in 1948 and 1949.
    </p>

    <p>
        In 1955, the government passed the Essential Commodities Act, which replaced earlier legislation and provided
        permanent measures for regulating the production, supply, and distribution of essential goods. The Act came
        into force on April 1, 1955.
    </p>

    <h2>Scope of this Act</h2>
    <p>
        This Act extends to the whole of India. The Act was enacted to ensure the availability of essential commodities
        to consumers and protect them from the exploitation of unscrupulous traders.
    </p>

    <h2>The basic objective of this Act</h2>
    <p>There are two main aims:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>To prevent hoarding and black marketing of foodstuffs to maintain or increase the supply of these essential commodities, and</li>
        <li>To secure equitable distribution and availability of these essential commodities.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What happens when a commodity is declared essential?</h2>
    <p>The Act empowered the government to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Regulate the production, distribution, and supply of essential commodities.</li>
        <li>Impose stock limits, price controls, and distribution restrictions.</li>
        <li>Issue orders to prevent hoarding and black-marketing of essential goods.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Sections and Schedules in the Act</h2>
    <p>
        The Act comprises 16 main sections and 1 Schedule. The sections provide the framework for implementing control
        orders, and the Act includes one Schedule, listing the commodities subject to regulation.
    </p>

    <p>
        The Schedule lists the specific items deemed essential commodities (e.g., food grains, oils, medicines, fuels, etc.)
        which the government can control to ensure their availability and prevent scarcity, price hikes, or exploitation
        in the market.
    </p>

    <h2>Section 1 - Short title and extent</h2>
    <p>(1) This Act may be called the Essential Commodities Act, of 1955.</p>
    <p>(2) It extends to the whole of India.</p>

    <h2>Section 2 - Definitions</h2>
    <p><strong>(a) Collector:</strong> This term refers to the main officer in charge, but it can also include an Additional Collector or other officers, such as a Sub-Divisional Officer, who are authorized by the Collector to do the same work and use the same powers under this law.</p>

    <p><strong>(b) Food-crops:</strong> There is no specific definition of Food Crops. It is related to both humans and animals. This includes crops like sugarcane is in foodstuffs and tea is not a foodstuff.</p>

    <p><strong>(c) Notified order:</strong> This means an order that has been officially published in the government’s Official Gazette.</p>
    <p>a. Order: This includes any direction given under a Notified order.</p>

    <p><strong>(d) State Government:</strong> When referring to a Union Territory, this means the administrator of that territory.</p>

    <p><strong>(e) Sugar:</strong> This includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Any sugar that has more than 90% sucrose (including sugar candy).</li>
        <li>Khandasari sugar, bura sugar, crushed sugar, or any sugar in crystals or powdered form.</li>
        <li>Raw sugar is produced in a vacuum pan sugar factory.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Case Laws</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Satpal Gupta v. State of Haryana:</strong> Foodstuff is related to both humans and animals. In this case,
            it was established that cattle and poultry foods are included within the meaning of the ‘foodstuff.
            Therefore, it concludes that foodstuff is related to both humans and animals.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>State of Bombay v. Virkumar Gulab Chand Shah:</strong> Turmeric has been included in the scope of
            foodstuff. In this case, it was established that the foodstuff includes raw materials, things used in the
            process and things used in the preparation of food. Therefore, turmeric has been included in the scope of
            foodstuff.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>S. Samuel, M.D., Harrisons v. Union of India:</strong> Tea is not a foodstuff. In this case, it was
            decided that tea is not a foodstuff and merely a stimulant. It is neither used in the preparation of food nor
            contains any nutritional value, however in general parlance also when a person takes tea doesn’t consider it
            as having food.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Section 2A - Essential Commodities</h2>
