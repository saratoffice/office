    <h3>The Schedule</h3>
    <p>
        The Schedule lists the commodities declared as essential commodities under the Act.
    </p>


    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        The Constitution of India originally had 395 articles, 22 parts, and 8 schedules when it was adopted in 1950.
        However, these numbers have changed over time due to amendments. As of now, the Constitution consists of
        448 articles, 25 parts, 12 schedules, and 104 amendments.
    </p>

    <p>
        Article 246 deals with the distribution of legislative powers between the Union and the States and it explicitly
        refers to the three lists in the 7th Schedule.
    </p>

    <h3>The 7th Schedule is divided into three parts:</h3>

    <h4>1. Union List (List I):</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            This list contains subjects on which only the Union Government can legislate. These are matters of national
            importance, such as defense, foreign affairs, atomic energy, banking, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
            There are 100 items in this list (as per the original Constitution, though it has been amended over time).
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>2. State List (List II):</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            This list contains subjects on which only the State Governments can legislate. These are matters of local
            or regional importance, such as police, public health, agriculture, local government, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
            The State List originally contained 61 items (now reduced through amendments).
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>3. Concurrent List (List III):</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            This list includes subjects on which both the Union and State Governments can legislate. In case of a conflict,
            the law made by the Union Government prevails.
        </li>
        <li>
            There are 52 items in this list, such as education, marriage, trade unions, criminal law, etc.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        In the Concurrent list, there is one entry no. 33, which is related to the Essential Commodity Act.
    </p>

    <h3>Entry No. 33</h3>
    <p>
        Trade and commerce in, and the production, supply and distribution of,—
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>(a) the products of any industry where the control of such industry by the Union is declared by Parliament by law to be expedient in the public interest, and imported goods of the same kind as such products;</li>
        <li>(b) foodstuffs, including edible oilseeds and oils;</li>
        <li>(c) cattle fodder, including oilcakes and other concentrates;</li>
        <li>(d) raw cotton, whether ginned or unginned, and cotton seed; and</li>
        <li>(e) raw jute.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why Invoking the Act?</h2>
    <p>
        In 1955, India was facing a food shortage and relied on imports, like wheat from the US, to feed the population.
        To prevent prices from rising during the busy festival season, the government took steps to make sure there was
        enough food, especially pulses. These measures were meant to stop traders from creating an artificial scarcity—
        a situation where they limit supply on purpose to raise prices.
    </p>

    <h2>Historical Background of the Act</h2>
    <p>
        The Essential Commodities Act traces its origins to 1939, when the Government of India enacted rules under the
        Defence of India Act to regulate essential goods during World War II (1939 – 1945). In 1946, the Essential Supplies
        (Temporary Powers) Ordinance was introduced, later replaced by the Essential Supplies (Temporary Powers) Act, 1946.
        After India gained independence in 1947, the Act was further extended through two resolutions in 1948 and 1949.
    </p>

    <p>
        In 1955, the government passed the Essential Commodities Act, which replaced earlier legislation and provided
        permanent measures for regulating the production, supply, and distribution of essential goods. The Act came
        into force on April 1, 1955.
    </p>

    <h2>Scope of this Act</h2>
    <p>
        This Act extends to the whole of India. The Act was enacted to ensure the availability of essential commodities
        to consumers and protect them from the exploitation of unscrupulous traders.
    </p>

    <h2>The basic objective of this Act</h2>
    <p>There are two main aims:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>To prevent hoarding and black marketing of foodstuffs to maintain or increase the supply of these essential commodities, and</li>
        <li>To secure equitable distribution and availability of these essential commodities.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What happens when a commodity is declared essential?</h2>
    <p>The Act empowered the government to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Regulate the production, distribution, and supply of essential commodities.</li>
        <li>Impose stock limits, price controls, and distribution restrictions.</li>
        <li>Issue orders to prevent hoarding and black-marketing of essential goods.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Sections and Schedules in the Act</h2>
    <p>
        The Act comprises 16 main sections and 1 Schedule. The sections provide the framework for implementing control
        orders, and the Act includes one Schedule, listing the commodities subject to regulation.
    </p>

    <p>
        The Schedule lists the specific items deemed essential commodities (e.g., food grains, oils, medicines, fuels, etc.)
        which the government can control to ensure their availability and prevent scarcity, price hikes, or exploitation
        in the market.
    </p>

    <h2>Section 1 - Short title and extent</h2>
    <p>(1) This Act may be called the Essential Commodities Act, of 1955.</p>
    <p>(2) It extends to the whole of India.</p>

    <h2>Section 2 - Definitions:</h2>

    <p>
        <strong>(a) Collector:</strong> This term refers to the main officer in charge, but it can also include
        an Additional Collector or other officers, such as a Sub-Divisional Officer, who are authorized by the
        Collector to do the same work and use the same powers under this law.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>(b) Food-crops:</strong> There is no specific definition of Food Crops. It is related to both
        humans and animals. This includes crops like sugarcane is in foodstuffs and tea is not a foodstuff.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>(c) Notified order:</strong> This means an order that has been officially published in the
        government’s Official Gazette.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>a. Order:</strong> This includes any direction given under a Notified order.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>(d) State Government:</strong> When referring to a Union Territory, this means the administrator
        of that territory.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>(e) Sugar:</strong> This includes:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Any sugar that has more than 90% sucrose (including sugar candy).</li>
        <li>Khandasari sugar, bura sugar, crushed sugar, or any sugar in crystals or powdered form.</li>
        <li>Raw sugar is produced in a vacuum pan sugar factory.</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Satpal Gupta v. State of Haryana:</strong> Foodstuff is related to both humans and animals.
            In this case, it was established that cattle and poultry foods are included within the meaning of
            the ‘foodstuff. Therefore, it concludes that foodstuff is related to both humans and animals.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>State of Bombay v. Virkumar Gulab Chand Shah:</strong> Turmeric has been included in the
            scope of foodstuff. In this case, it was established that the foodstuff includes raw materials,
            things used in the process and things used in the preparation of food. Therefore, turmeric has
            been included in the scope of foodstuff.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>S. Samuel, M.D., Harrisons v. Union of India:</strong> Tea is not a foodstuff. In this case,
            it was decided that tea is not a foodstuff and merely a stimulant. It is neither used in the
            preparation of food nor contains any nutritional value, however in general parlance also when a
            person takes tea doesn’t consider it as having food.
        </li>
    </ol>
 <h2>Section 2A - Essential Commodities:</h2>

    <p>
        <strong>(1)</strong> What is an Essential Commodity? An "essential commodity" is a product listed in

    </ol>

    <p>
        <strong>(2)</strong> Changes to the List: The Central Government can change this list if it believes

    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Add a new item to the list.</li>

     <h2>Section 3 - Powers to Control Production, Supply, Distribution, etc:</h2>

    <p>
        The Powers to Control Production, Supply, and Distribution are conferred upon governments to regulate
        or control the production, supply, and distribution of essential goods. These powers help prevent
        hoarding, black marketing, and ensure equitable distribution during shortages or emergencies.
        Authorities can impose stock limits, licensing requirements, and price controls to safeguard public
        interest.
    </p>

    <h2>Section 3(1): Central Government's Power to Regulate or Prohibit Essential Commodities</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Purpose:</strong> If the Central Government believes that it is necessary to ensure a
            steady supply of essential commodities, to make sure these goods are available at fair prices,
            or to secure supplies for the defence of India (e.g., during war or military operations), it can
            issue orders to regulate or ban the production, supply, and distribution of essential goods.
        </li>
        <li>
            This can include controlling trade and commerce in these goods.
        </li>
    </ul>

            The government can require licenses or permits for producing or manufacturing essential
            commodities (like food, medicine, etc.).
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>(b) Using Wasteland (Restricted) or Arable (Unused) Land for Farming:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The government can require that unused land be used to grow food crops. This helps to grow,
            maintain and increase cultivation of any general or specific food crop..
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>(c) Controlling Prices:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The government can control how much essential goods (like food and fuel) can be bought or sold
            for, to keep prices fair.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>(d) Regulating Storage and Distribution:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The government can regulate how goods are stored, transported, sold, and consumed. This may
            include requiring permits or licenses for these activities.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>(e) Preventing Hoarding:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The government can stop people or businesses from withholding essential goods that are typically
            for sale, to prevent shortages and unfair price hikes.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>(f) Selling to the Government:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            If someone is holding a stock of essential goods (or producing them), the government can require
            them to sell part or all of their stock to the government or government-controlled entities.
        </li>
        <li>
            The government can also specify how much a producer should sell, depending on the local supply
            and demand.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>(g) Regulating Harmful Transactions:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The government can restrict or stop certain business activities involving foodstuffs or
            essential commodities if it believes these activities might harm the public.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>(h) Collecting Information:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The government can require businesses to provide data and statistics related to the production,
            sale, and distribution of essential goods. This helps with effective regulation.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>(i)</strong></p>
    <ol type="i">
        <li>
            <strong>Record-Keeping and Inspections:</strong> The government can require people and businesses
            involved in essential goods to maintain records and books (like financial accounts) and allow
            inspectors to check them. They may also need to provide specific information when asked.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Issuing Licenses and Permits:</strong> The government can issue licenses, permits, or
            other official documents for businesses, and charge fees for these. They may also require a
            security deposit, which can be taken if the conditions of the license or permit are violated.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p><strong>(j) Search and Seizure:</strong></p>
    <ol type="i">
        <li>
            Authorized officials (like inspectors) can enter and search premises, vehicles, ships, or even
            animals if they suspect a violation of the rules.
        </li>
        <li>
            If the inspector finds illegal goods or contraband, they can seize the goods.
        </li>
        <li>
            The government can also seize books, accounts, or documents related to the business if they are
            relevant to any legal proceedings. The business owner can take copies of these documents while
            they are being inspected.
        </li>
    </ol>  
    
    <h2>Section 3(3): Price Payments for Essential Commodities</h2>

    <p>
        If someone sells an essential commodity following a government order (like selling stock to the
        government), the price they get is based on:
    </p>

    <ol type="a">
        <li>
            <strong>Agreed Price:</strong> If the buyer and seller can agree on a price that follows the
            controlled price rules, that's the price they get.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Controlled Price:</strong> If no agreement can be made, the controlled price
            (if set by Govt.) will apply.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Market Price:</strong> If no controlled price is set, the price will be based on the
            market rate at the time of sale.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Section (3A) Special Provisions for Foodstuffs</h2>

    <ol type="i">
        <li>
            If the Central Government believes it's necessary to control rising prices or prevent hoarding
            of food in a certain area, it can issue a notification in the Official Gazette. This notification
            will regulate the price at which food is sold in that area, even if it contradicts earlier rules.
        </li>
        <li>
            Any notification issued under this rule will be valid for a period of up to three months, as
            mentioned in the notification.
        </li>
        <li>
            After the notification is issued, if someone sells the specified food in the mentioned area,
            the price they charge will be:
            <ol type="a">
                <li>
                    If the price can be agreed upon, it will be the agreed price, but it must be consistent
                    with any controlled price.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If no agreement on price can be reached, it will be the price based on the controlled
                    price, if one exists.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If neither of the above applies, the price will be based on the average market rate for
                    the food in that area during the three months before the notification was issued.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
            For determining the average market rate, an officer appointed by the Central Government will
            check the market prices in the area or a nearby area. The determined average market rate will be
            final and cannot be disputed in court.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Section (3B): Compensation for Sale of Food Items to Government Without Notification:</h2>

    <p>
        If someone is ordered to sell a certain type of foodgrain, edible oilseed, or edible oil to the
        Central or State Government (or to a government officer, agent, or a government-owned corporation),
        and no price notification has been issued for it, or if the notification has expired, the person
        will be paid a procurement price.
    </p>

    <p>
        This price is set by the State Government with prior approval from the Central Government, and the
        price will be based on the following factors:
    </p>

    <ol type="a">
        <li>
            Any controlled price that is already set for that specific foodgrain, oilseed, or oil, either
            under this law or another law.
        </li>
        <li>
            The overall crop prospects (how good the harvest is expected to be).
        </li>
        <li>
            The need to ensure that this food is available to consumers at reasonable prices, especially
            for vulnerable groups.
        </li>
        <li>
            Any recommendations from the Agricultural Prices Commission about the price of the foodgrain,
            oilseed, or oil.
        </li>
    </ol>
<h2>Section (3C): Price Determination for Sugar Sale:</h2>

    <p>
        If a sugar producer is required by the government to sell sugar (whether to the Central or State
        Government, its officers, or other buyers) under a government order, the price for that sugar will
        be decided by the Central Government. This applies whether there was a prior notification under
        Subsection (3A).
    </p>

    <p>The price the producer receives will consider:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            The cost of producing sugar, including the cost of converting sugarcane into sugar and
            transporting it to the factory.
        </li>
        <li>
            A reasonable profit or return on the money invested in the sugar business.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        The Central Government may set different prices for different areas, factories, or types of sugar.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Provisional Price Determination for Earlier Seasons:</strong></p>

    <p>
        If the price for sugar produced up to the 2008-2009 season was decided provisionally, the final
        price will be set based on the rules that applied before October 1, 2009.
    </p>

    <h2>Section - (3D) - Control Over Sale and Movement of Sugar</h2>

    <p>
        The Central Government can order that no producer, importer, or exporter of sugar can sell, give
        away, or move sugar from their factory's storage (whether inside or outside the factory) or the
        warehouses of importers or exporters, unless they follow specific government directions.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Exception:</strong></p>

    <p>
        This rule does not apply if the sugar is pledged (used as collateral) by the producer or importer
        to a scheduled bank (a bank recognized by the Reserve Bank of India) or a similar bank. However,
        even in this case, the bank can only sell the pledged sugar if the Central Government gives
        permission.
    </p>
<h2>Section - 3(4) - Appointment of an Authorized Controller</h2>

    <p>
        If the Central Government believes that it is necessary to maintain or increase the production and
        supply of an essential commodity, it can issue an order to appoint a person (called an authorized
        controller) to oversee and manage part or all of the operations of a business involved in producing
        and supplying that commodity.
    </p>

    <p>
        The authorized controller will have the following powers and responsibilities while the order is
        in effect:
    </p>

    <ol type="a">
        <li>
            <strong>Following Government Instructions:</strong><br>
            The controller must carry out their duties based on instructions from the Central Government.
            However, they cannot give directions that go against any law or rules that govern the management
            of the business, unless the order specifically allows them to do so.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Managing the Business:</strong><br>
            The business (or the specific part of the business) must be run according to the directions
            given by the authorized controller. Any manager or person in charge of the business must follow
            these directions.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Section - 3(5): Notification of Orders:</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>General Orders:</strong> If the order affects many people, it must be published in the
            Official Gazette (public notice).
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Orders to Individuals:</strong> If the order affects a specific person or business, it
            must be served directly to them. If that’s not possible, the order can be posted on their
            premises, with proof from witnesses.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Section - 3(6): Parliament Oversight:</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Any order made by the government must be laid before both Houses of Parliament after it is
            issued. This ensures that lawmakers can review the government's actions.
        </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Section 4: Imposition of Duties on State Governments, etc.</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>
            An order made under Section 3 can delegate (give) powers and responsibilities to the Central
            Government, State Government, or their officers. It also allows these orders to give directions
            to government officers and authorities on how to exercise their powers or perform their duties.
        </li>
        <li>
            In simpler terms, this section allows the government to create specific rules or orders that may
            require state or central government bodies and officials to take certain actions related to the
            control or regulation of essential commodities (like food items, medicines, etc.). It also means
            that these orders can be used to direct the governments or their officers to carry out tasks in a
            particular way to ensure that essential commodities are handled properly.
        </li>
        <li>
            So, if the government wants to control the production, supply, or distribution of essential
            goods, this section allows them to instruct the relevant authorities at the national or state
            level on how to do so.
        </li>
    </ul>

<h2>Section 5: Delegation of Powers.</h2>

    <p>
        The Central Government can, through an official order, decide that certain powers given to them
        under Section 3 of the Essential Commodities Act can also be used by other people or organizations,
        such as:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Any Officers or Authorities under the Central Government:</strong>
            The Central Government can give its powers to lower-ranking officials or departments working under it.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>State Governments or Their Officers:</strong>
            The Central Government can also allow State Governments or their officials to use these powers.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p><strong>Conditions:</strong></p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            The order will clearly state which powers are being given to these officials and under what
            conditions they can use them.
        </li>
    </ul>

     <h2>Section 6 - Effect of Orders Inconsistent with Other Laws:</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Meaning:</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        If an order is made under Section 3 of the Essential Commodities Act (e.g., controlling the production
        or supply of essential goods), it will override any conflicting rules or laws that are not part of
        this Act. This means that even if other laws say something different, the order under the Essential
        Commodities Act will still apply.
    </p>

    <h2>Section 6A: Confiscation of Essential Commodities:</h2>

    <p>
        This section outlines what happens if essential commodities are seized (taken) under an order made
        in connection with Section 3. Here's a breakdown:
    </p>

    <h3>(1) Seizure and Reporting</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>
            If essential commodities are seized (taken) based on an order under Section 3, a report of the
            seizure must be made without unnecessary delay to the Collector (the official in charge of the
            district or city).
        </li>
        <li>
            The Collector may inspect the seized goods. If the Collector finds that the order has been
            violated, he can order the following:
        </li>
    </ul>

    <ol type="a">
        <li>Confiscation (taking away) of the seized essential commodity.</li>
        <li>
            Confiscation of any containers (like packages or boxes) that were holding the seized goods.
        </li>
        <li>
            Confiscation of any vehicles, animals, or vessels used to transport the seized goods (e.g.,
            trucks, boats, or animals).
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p><strong>Exception:</strong></p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            If foodgrains or edible oilseeds are seized from a producer (a farmer who made them), they cannot
            be confiscated, as long as the producer owns them and they are being used for personal purposes.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Further Exception:</strong></p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            If an animal, vehicle, or vessel is used to carry essential commodities for commercial purposes
            (like transporting goods for hire), the owner of the transport vehicle has the option to pay a
            fine instead of having the vehicle or animal confiscated. The fine will be based on the market
            price of the seized goods at the time of seizure.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>(2) Sale of Seized Commodities</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>
            If the seized goods are perishable (they will spoil quickly) or it’s in the public interest,
            the Collector can:
        </li>
    </ul>

    <ol type="i">
        <li>
            Sell the goods at a controlled price (if a price is fixed for such goods under this Act or any
            other law).
        </li>
        <li>
            If no price is fixed, the Collector can sell the goods at a public auction.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p><strong>For Foodgrains:</strong></p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            In the case of foodgrains, the Collector may sell them through fair price shops
            (government-regulated shops) at the price fixed by the Central or State Government to ensure
            that they are available at fair prices to the public.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>(3) Handling the Sale Proceeds</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>
            If the seized goods are sold (either at a controlled price or through auction), the proceeds
            (money from the sale) will be handled in the following ways:
        </li>
    </ul>

    <ol type="a">
        <li>
            If the Collector doesn't confiscate the goods, the proceeds will go to the owner of the goods.
        </li>
        <li>
            If the Collector's confiscation order is appealed and overturned, the proceeds go to the owner.
        </li>
        <li>
            If a person is acquitted (found not guilty) in a court case related to the seized goods, the
            proceeds from the sale will also go to the person who owned the goods.
        </li>
    </ol>

<h2>Section 6B - Issuance of Show Cause Notice before Confiscation of Essential Commodity:</h2>

    <p>
        There is no order for confiscation of any essential commodity that is passed against any person
        without giving him a written notice that informs him about the grounds on which such order is
        proposed and provides him an opportunity to make his presentation in writing.
    </p>

    <h2>Section 6C - Appeal Against Confiscation Order:</h2>

    <h3>(1) Appeal Process:</h3>

    <p>
        If someone is unhappy with an order of confiscation (where their goods are taken by the government)
        under Section 6A, they can appeal to a judicial authority (District and Sessions Judge) appointed by
        the State Government.
    </p>

    <p>
        The appeal must be made within one month from the date they are informed of the confiscation order.
        The judicial authority (District and Sessions Judge) will hear the case and can either:
    </p>

    <ol type="i">
        <li>Confirm the confiscation order,</li>
        <li>Change (modify) the order, or</li>
        <li>Cancel the order.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>(2) Compensation After Modification or Acquittal:</h3>

    <p>
        If the judicial authority changes or cancels the confiscation order, or if a court finds the person
        not guilty in a related prosecution, and the seized goods cannot be returned for some reason, then
        the person is entitled to be paid for the goods.
    </p>

    <p>
        The payment will be calculated as though the goods were sold to the government.
    </p>

    <p>
        The payment will include the price of the goods, along with reasonable interest starting from the
        day the goods were seized.
    </p>

    <p>The price will be decided based on the type of goods:</p>

    <ol type="i">
        <li>Foodgrains, edible oilseeds, or edible oils: As per Section 3(3B).</li>
        <li>Sugar: As per Section 3(3C).</li>
        <li>Other essential commodities: As per Section 3(3).</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Section 6D - Award of confiscation not to interfere with other punishments:</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>
            If the Collector orders the confiscation (seizure) of goods under this Act, it does not mean that
            the person who owned the goods is free from other punishments.
        </li>
        <li>
            The confiscation of goods (which is another form of punishment) does not prevent the imposition
            of other penalties, such as imprisonment or fines, under Section 7.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Section 6E - Bar of Jurisdiction in Certain Cases:</h2>

    <ol type="i">
        <li>
            When the government seizes an essential commodity (like food, fuel, etc.) under an order, or
            when it seizes things related to it (like a vehicle, animal, or packaging used to carry the
            goods), these items are taken pending confiscation (pending the decision to permanently take
            them away).
        </li>
        <li>
            In such cases, only the Collector (or the State Government) has the authority to decide what
            happens to these seized goods.
        </li>
        <li>
            No other court, tribunal, or authority (such as any judge or other legal body) can interfere or
            make any decisions on:
            <ul>
                <li>Who gets the goods</li>
                <li>What happens to the goods</li>
                <li>When or how they are returned or disposed of</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        This rule applies even if other laws say otherwise.

    <h3>(5) Additional Punishment</h3>
    <p>
        Courts may prohibit repeat offenders from carrying on business in the essential commodity for a
        minimum of six months.
    </p>

    <h2>Section 7A: Recovery of Amounts as Arrears of Land Revenue</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Unpaid amounts may be recovered with 15% annual simple interest.</li>
        <li>Recovery is treated as land revenue or public demand.</li>
        <li>No court may restrain such recovery.</li>
        <li>Invalid recoveries must be refunded with interest.</li>
    </ul>

   <h2>Section 8 - Attempts and Abetment:</h2>

    <p><strong>Breakdown:</strong></p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Attempt to Contravene:</strong> If a person tries to violate (or contravene) an order made
            under Section 3 of the Act, even if the violation isn't completed, the law treats it as if the
            violation has already occurred.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Abetment:</strong> If a person encourages, assists, or incites another person to violate
            the order (known as abetting), they will also be treated as having violated the order themselves.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p><strong>Consequence:</strong></p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Deemed to Have Contravened:</strong> Both the person attempting the violation and the one
            abetting it will be deemed to have contravened the order, meaning they can be held legally
            responsible and face penalties, as if they had fully violated the order.
        </li>
    </ul>

<h2>Section 9 - False Statement:</h2>

    <p>If a person:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Gives false information when they are required to provide information or make a statement under
            any order made under Section 3 of the Act, and they know or have reasonable cause to believe that
            the information is false, or they do not believe it to be true, or
        </li>
        <li>
            Records a false statement in any book, account, record, declaration, return, or any other
            document they are required to maintain or submit under the Act,
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>Then, that person can be punished with:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Imprisonment for up to five years, or</li>
        <li>A fine, or</li>
        <li>Both imprisonment and fine.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Section 10 - Offences by Companies:</h2>

    <p><strong>(1)</strong> If a company breaks the law (violates an order under Section 3 of the Act):</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Every person who was in charge of, and responsible for, running the company at the time the
            violation happened will also be considered guilty of the offence.
        </li>
        <li>
            This means that both the company and the responsible individuals can be punished.
        </li>
        <li>
            However, if the person in charge can prove that the violation happened without their knowledge,
            or that they did everything possible to prevent it, they won’t be punished.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>(2)</strong> If the violation was caused by a director or other officer of the company:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            If it can be proven that the violation happened because of the approval, help, or negligence of
            any director, manager, or other officer of the company, that person will also be guilty and can
            be punished as well.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Section 10A - Offences to be Cognizable:</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>
            This section means that any offence under the Essential Commodities Act is a cognizable offence.
        </li>
        <li>
            In simple terms, a cognizable offence is one where the police can arrest the person without a
            warrant and start an investigation without permission from a court.
        </li>
        <li>
            So, if someone breaks the law under this Act, the police have the authority to take action
            immediately, arrest the person, and investigate the offence without needing to get a court
            order first.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Section 10B - Power of Court to Publish Information About Convicted Companies:</h2>

    <p><strong>(1)</strong> When a company is convicted under this Act, the court has the power to make public
        certain details about the company, such as:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>The company’s name and place of business,</li>
        <li>The nature of the offence (what the company did wrong),</li>
        <li>The fact that the company has been convicted,</li>
        <li>And any other details the court thinks are important.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        This information will be published at the company’s expense, in newspapers or in any other way the
        court decides.
    </p>

    <p><strong>(2)</strong> However, the court can’t publish this information until:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>The time for the company to appeal the court’s decision has passed, or</li>
        <li>If an appeal is made, it has been decided.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>(3)</strong> The cost of publishing this information will be charged to the company as if it
        were a fine imposed by the court.</p>

    <h2>Section 10C - Presumption of Culpable Mental State:</h2>

    <p><strong>(1)</strong> In any case where a person is being prosecuted for an offence under the Essential
        Commodities Act that requires a "culpable mental state" (meaning the person must have had a guilty
        mind, such as knowing they were breaking the law or intending to do something wrong), the court will
        assume that the person had that mental state.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            However, the accused person can defend themselves by proving that they did not have that guilty
            mind when committing the act.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>(2)</strong> What does "culpable mental state" mean?</p>

    <ul>
        <li>It includes things like:</li>
        <li>Intention (they meant to break the law),</li>
        <li>Motive (the reason they did it),</li>
        <li>Knowledge of the fact (they knew something was true that made the act wrong),</li>
        <li>Belief or reason to believe in something that makes the act unlawful.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>(3)</strong> In court, a fact is considered proven only if the judge is completely convinced
        (beyond a reasonable doubt), not just if it seems likely or probable.</p>

    <h2>Section 11: Cognizance of Offences</h2>
    <p>
        No court shall take cognizance of any offence punishable under this Act except upon a report in
        writing of the facts constituting such offence, made by:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            A public servant as defined under Section 21 of the Indian Penal Code; or
        </li>
        <li>
            Any person aggrieved by the offence; or
        </li>
        <li>
            A recognised consumer association, whether or not the person making the report is a member of
            such association.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Who is a Public Servant?</h3>
    <p>
        As per Section 21 of the Indian Penal Code, a public servant includes:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Judges;</li>
        <li>Government officers;</li>
        <li>Police officers;</li>
        <li>Municipal employees;</li>
        <li>Other persons performing official duties on behalf of the government.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Recognised Consumer Association</h3>
    <p>
        A recognised consumer association must be:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>A voluntary association; and</li>
        <li>
            Registered under the Companies Act, 1956, or any other corresponding law for the time being in force.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Examples include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Consumer guidance societies;</li>
        <li>Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) working in the field of consumer rights.</li>
    </ul>
<h2>Section 12: Special Provision Regarding Fine</h2>
    <p>
        Notwithstanding anything contained in Section 29 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, which places
        limits on the amount of fine that can be imposed by a Magistrate, this section empowers certain
        Magistrates to impose a fine exceeding ₹5,000 for contravention of an order made under Section 3 of
        the Essential Commodities Act.
    </p>
    <p>This power may be exercised by:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A Metropolitan Magistrate; or</li>
        <li>
            A Judicial Magistrate of the First Class who has been specially empowered by the State Government
            for this purpose.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Section 12A: Power to Try Summarily</h2>

    <h3>(1) Summary Trial</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            If the Central Government considers it necessary to ensure speedy disposal of cases relating to
            contraventions of orders under Section 3, it may issue a notification in the Official Gazette.
        </li>
        <li>
            Such notification shall declare certain orders as “special orders” for the purpose of summary
            trial.
        </li>
        <li>
            A summary trial involves a faster and simplified procedure, generally used for less serious
            offences.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>(2) Notification and Duration</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The notification will specify which orders are to be tried summarily.
        </li>
        <li>
            The notification remains in force for a period of two years unless cancelled earlier.
        </li>
        <li>
            On expiry or cancellation of the notification, cases already instituted shall continue to be
            tried summarily.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>(3) Authorities Competent to Conduct Summary Trials</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Judicial Magistrates of the First Class or Metropolitan Magistrates specially empowered by the
            State Government may conduct summary trials.
        </li>
        <li>
            The trial shall follow the procedure laid down in Sections 262 to 265 of the Code of Criminal
            Procedure, 1973.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>(4) Punishment in Summary Trials</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The maximum sentence that may be imposed in a summary trial is:
            <ul>
                <li>Imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year; or</li>
                <li>A fine not exceeding ₹5,000; or</li>
                <li>Both imprisonment and fine.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            If the Magistrate considers that the nature of the case warrants a more severe punishment, the
            case may be converted into a regular trial.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>(5) Restriction on Appeals</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            No appeal shall lie where the sentence imposed is:
            <ul>
                <li>Imprisonment for a term not exceeding one month; and</li>
                <li>A fine not exceeding ₹2,000.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Appeals are permitted if the punishment exceeds the above limits.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>(6) Pending Cases</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Cases pending at the time of commencement of this provision or issuance of notification, where
            no witnesses have been examined, shall be tried summarily.
        </li>
        <li>
            If such a case is pending before a Magistrate not empowered to conduct summary trials, it shall
            be transferred to a competent Magistrate.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Section 12B: Grant of Injunction by Civil Courts</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            No civil court shall grant an injunction or interim relief restraining any action taken or
            intended to be taken by:
            <ul>
                <li>The Central Government,</li>
                <li>The State Government, or</li>
                <li>Any public officer</li>
            </ul>
            under this Act.
        </li>
        <li>
            Such injunction may be sought only after giving prior notice to the concerned Government or
            officer.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Section 13: Presumption as to Orders</h2>

    <h3>Meaning and Scope</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            When an order is produced before a court, it shall be presumed that the order was duly made by
            the competent authority under the powers conferred by this Act.
        </li>
        <li>
            If an order appears to be signed and issued by an authority empowered under the Act, the court
            shall presume that it was validly made and properly executed.
        </li>
        <li>
            The court will assume that the order complies with all legal requirements and procedures.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Indian Evidence Act, 1872</h3>
    <p>
        This presumption is based on <a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/731516/" target="_blank" class="section-link">
    Section 114</a>
 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, which allows courts to
        presume the existence of certain facts unless disproved.
    </p>

    <h3>Burden of Proof</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The burden of proof lies on the person challenging the order.
        </li>
        <li>
            The challenger must prove that the order was not issued by a competent authority or was issued
            improperly.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Illustration</h3>
    <p>
        If a government officer issues an order under this Act and it is challenged in court, the court will
        presume that the officer acted lawfully and within authority unless evidence proves otherwise.
    </p>

    <h2>Section 14: Burden of Proof in Certain Cases</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Where a person is accused of contravening an order under Section 3 by doing an act without a
            permit, license, or authority, the burden lies on the accused to prove that such authority existed.
        </li>
        <li>
            This is an exception to the general rule of criminal law, where the prosecution normally bears
            the burden of proving guilt.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Section 15: Protection of Action Taken Under the Act</h2>

    <h3>(1) Protection of Individuals</h3>
    <p>
        No suit, prosecution, or other legal proceeding shall lie against any person for anything done in
        good faith in pursuance of an order made under Section 3.
    </p>

    <h3>(2) Protection of Government</h3>
    <p>
        No legal proceeding shall lie against the Government for any damage caused by actions taken in good
        faith under this Act.
    </p>

    <h2>Section 15A: Prosecution of Public Servants</h2>
    <p>
        No court shall take cognizance of an offence alleged to have been committed by a public servant while
        acting or purporting to act in discharge of official duties under Section 3, except with prior
        sanction:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            From the Central Government, where the public servant is employed under the Union Government; or
        </li>
        <li>
            From the State Government, where the public servant is employed under the State Government.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Legal Implications</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Encourages effective enforcement of the Act.</li>
        <li>Protects officials from harassment for actions taken honestly.</li>
        <li>
            Protection applies only when actions are taken in good faith and within lawful authority.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Illustrative Example</h3>
    <p>
        If a Civil Supplies Officer seizes wheat stock believing it violates a Section 3 order, and later it
        is found that the trader had a valid permit, the officer cannot be sued or prosecuted provided the
        action was taken honestly and within official powers.

    <h2>Landmark Judgments under the Essential Commodities Act</h2>

    <h3>1. Nathu Lal v. State of Madhya Pradesh (<a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1834977/" target="_blank" class="section-link">
    AIR 1966 SC 43</a>)</h3>

    <h4>Facts</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The appellant, Nathu Lal, was a foodgrain dealer in Dhar, Madhya Pradesh.
        </li>
        <li>
            He was found storing 885 maunds and 2¼ seers of wheat without a license, as required under
            Section 7 of the Essential Commodities Act, 1955.
        </li>
        <li>
            He claimed that he had applied for the required license and believed it would be issued soon,
            based on assurances from government authorities.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Held</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The Supreme Court held that <strong>mens rea</strong> (guilty intention) is an essential element
            for proving an offence under Section 7 of the Act.
        </li>
        <li>
            The Court observed that merely because the Act is a welfare legislation, the requirement of
            intention cannot be ignored.
        </li>
        <li>
            The objective of the Act would not be defeated by insisting on proof of intention.
        </li>
        <li>
            Since Nathu Lal lacked guilty intent, he was not punished despite a technical violation of the law.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. State of Madhya Pradesh v. Narayan Singh &amp; Others (<a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1410744/" target="_blank" class="section-link">
    AIR 1989 SC 1789</a>)</h3>

    <h4>Facts</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The respondents were truck drivers, cleaners, and helpers.
        </li>
        <li>
            They were caught transporting fertilizer bags from Indore to Maharashtra without a permit, as
            required under the Fertilizers (Movement Control) Order, 1973.
        </li>
        <li>
            Although they possessed invoices, they did not have the necessary permits and claimed ignorance
            of the permit requirement and the nature of the goods.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Held</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Section 7 of the Essential Commodities Act was amended in 1967 to include the words
            <em>“whether knowingly, intentionally, or otherwise.”</em>
        </li>
        <li>
            This amendment introduced the principle of <strong>strict liability</strong>, where intent or
            knowledge is not always required to establish guilt.
        </li>
        <li>
            However, the Supreme Court found that the prosecution failed to establish wrongful intention
            or negligence on the part of the respondents.
        </li>
        <li>
            As a result, no punishment was imposed.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The Essential Commodities Act, 1955 is a crucial legislation designed to safeguard public interest
            by regulating the production, supply, and pricing of essential commodities.
        </li>
        <li>
            The Act grants wide powers to the Central Government to ensure equitable distribution and prevent
            hoarding and black-marketing.
        </li>
        <li>
            Earlier judicial decisions emphasized the requirement of <strong>mens rea</strong>, but later
            amendments introduced strict liability for certain offences.
        </li>
        <li>
            Nevertheless, courts continue to insist on clear and convincing evidence before recording a
            conviction under the Act.
        </li>
