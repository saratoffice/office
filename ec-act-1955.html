The Schedule
</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
The Constitution of India originally had 395 Articles, 22 Parts, and 8 Schedules when it was adopted in 1950. Over time, these numbers have changed due to amendments. At present, the Constitution consists of 448 Articles, 25 Parts, 12 Schedules, and 104 Amendments.
</p>

<p>
Article 246 deals with the distribution of legislative powers between the Union and the States and explicitly refers to the three lists in the Seventh Schedule.
</p>

<h3>The Seventh Schedule</h3>

<h4>Union List (List I)</h4>
<p>
Subjects of national importance such as defence, foreign affairs, atomic energy and banking. It contains 100 items.
</p>

<h4>State List (List II)</h4>
<p>
Subjects of local or regional importance such as police, public health, agriculture and local government. Originally contained 61 items.
</p>

<h4>Concurrent List (List III)</h4>
<p>
Subjects on which both Union and States can legislate. Union law prevails in case of conflict. Entry No. 33 relates to Essential Commodities.
</p>

<p>
Entry No. 33 covers trade, commerce, production, supply and distribution of industrial products, foodstuffs, cattle fodder, raw cotton and raw jute.
</p>

<h2>Why Invoking the Act</h2>
<p>
In 1955, India faced food shortages and depended on imports such as wheat from the United States. The Act was invoked to prevent hoarding, black marketing and artificial scarcity during periods of high demand.
</p>

<h2>Historical Background</h2>
<p>
The Act traces its origin to wartime controls under the Defence of India Act, 1939. It evolved through the Essential Supplies Ordinance, 1946 and later became permanent legislation in 1955.
</p>

<h2>Scope and Objective</h2>
<p>
The Act extends to the whole of India and aims to ensure availability of essential commodities, prevent exploitation and secure equitable distribution.
</p>

<h2>Effect of Declaring a Commodity Essential</h2>
<p>
The Government may regulate production, impose stock limits, control prices and prevent hoarding and black marketing.
</p>

<h2>Section-wise Explanation</h2>

<h3>Section 1 – Short Title and Extent</h3>
<p>

<h3>Section 2 – Definitions</h3>

Deal with cognizance, fines, summary trials, injunctions, presumptions, burden of proof, protection of good faith actions and prosecution of public servants.
</p>

<h3>Section 16 – Repeals and Savings</h3>
<p>
Repeals earlier laws while saving prior orders and actions.
</p>

<h2>Landmark Judgments</h2>
