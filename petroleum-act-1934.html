            A certificate issued under this section is admissible as evidence in any
            legal proceedings related to the petroleum sample tested. It is
            considered conclusive proof, unless proven otherwise, that the petroleum
            is Class A, Class B, or Class C, and if it is Class B or Class C, the
            certificate will also prove the flashpoint.

            receiving the test result.
        </li>
        <li>
            To do this, the owner or their agent must apply to the officer (appointed
            under Section 14) and pay the required fee. Fresh samples of the petroleum
            will be taken and tested in the presence of the owner, their agent, or a
            person they choose to represent them.

                    Cancel the original certificate issued under Section 19.

            transporting, or storing petroleum illegally (as mentioned in clauses (a),

                <li>The petroleum involved in the offence be taken away (confiscated), or</li>
                <li>
                    If the person was caught for importing, transporting, or storing more

                    were handling can be confiscated.

            If an accident caused by the ignition of petroleum or petroleum vapour
            results in serious injury to people or property, but no one is killed, the

            across multiple sessions). If both Houses of Parliament agree to change or
