<p><strong>3. Import, Transport, and Storage of Petroleum</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>No one is allowed to import, transport, or store any petroleum
unless they follow the rules set under <strong>Section
4</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>No one is allowed to import <strong>Petroleum Class A</strong>,
or transport or store any petroleum, unless they have a

to the rules made under <strong>Section 4</strong>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>4. Rules for the Import, Transport, and Storage of
Petroleum</strong></p>

<p>The <strong>Central Government</strong> can make rules on the
following matters:</p>

banning its import in other places.</p>
<p><strong>(b)</strong> Setting rules for how petroleum should be
imported.</p>
<p><strong>(c)</strong> Setting deadlines for when people must apply for

</ol>

<p><strong>(a)</strong> Setting the conditions under which petroleum can
be produced, refined, or blended.</p>
<p><strong>(b)</strong> Regulating how petroleum is removed from places
where it is produced, refined, or blended. The government can also

<strong>Petroleum Class A</strong>) unless it has passed the required
tests.</p>

<p><strong>6. Warning on Receptacles Containing Petroleum Class
A</strong></p>
<p>All containers holding <strong>Petroleum Class A</strong> must have a
clear warning label. The label should be stamped, embossed, painted, or

transported, stored, produced, refined, or blended. The authorized
officer has the power to inspect and take samples of the petroleum found
at those locations for testing purposes.</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>Central Government</strong> may establish rules to
regulate:</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>(a)</strong> The process for taking samples of petroleum for
testing.</p>
<p><strong>(b)</strong> The circumstances under which payment will be
made for the value of the samples taken, and how such payments will be

<p><strong>(c)</strong> The general procedures for officers exercising
the powers outlined in this section.</p>

<p><strong>15. Standard Test Apparatus</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>A <strong>standard apparatus</strong> for testing the
<strong>flashpoint</strong> of petroleum will be kept with an officer
appointed by the <strong>Central Government</strong>, as announced in
the <strong>Official Gazette</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>The apparatus will be labelled with the words <strong>"Standard
Test Apparatus"</strong>. It will be checked and updated as needed,
according to the rules under <strong>Section 21</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>Standard Test Apparatus</strong> will be available
for inspection by anyone who wants to check it, if they pay the required
fee. Inspections can be done at reasonable times.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>16. Certification of Other Test Apparatus</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The officer appointed under <strong>Section 15</strong> will,
upon payment of the required fee (if any), compare any apparatus used to
test the <strong>flash-point</strong> of petroleum with the
<strong>Standard Test Apparatus</strong>. People can submit their
apparatus for this comparison.</p></li>
<li><p>If the officer finds that the apparatus agrees with the
<strong>Standard Test Apparatus</strong> within the allowed limits, the
officer will:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Engrave a special number and the date of comparison on the
apparatus.</p></li>
<li><p>Issue a certificate stating that the apparatus was compared with
the <strong>Standard Test Apparatus</strong> and meets the required
standards. The certificate will also mention any corrections needed in
the test results using that apparatus.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The certificate issued under this section will be valid for a
period decided by the rules.</p></li>
<li><p>The certificate will be considered proof that the apparatus meets
the required standards, unless proven otherwise, for as long as the
certificate is valid.</p></li>

</ol>
<p><strong>17. Testing Officers</strong></p>

on the test results.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>18. Manner of Test</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>All tests on petroleum must be done using a <strong>test
apparatus</strong> that has a valid certificate (under <strong>Section

certificate and follow the rules set out in <strong>Section
21</strong>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>19. Certificate of Testing</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>After testing petroleum samples, the <strong>testing
officer</strong> will issue a certificate stating whether the petroleum
is <strong>Petroleum Class A</strong>, <strong>Class B</strong>, or
<strong>Class C</strong>. If it's <strong>Class B</strong> or
<strong>Class C</strong>, the certificate will also state the
<strong>flash-point</strong> of the petroleum.</p></li>
<li><p>The officer must give a <strong>certified copy</strong> of the
certificate to the person who requested it, for a fee. This certified
copy can be used as evidence in court to prove the contents of the
original certificate.</p></li>
<li><p>A certificate issued under this section is <strong>admissible as
evidence</strong> in any legal proceedings related to the petroleum
sample tested. It is considered <strong>conclusive proof</strong>,
unless proven otherwise, that the petroleum is <strong>Class A</strong>,
<strong>Class B</strong>, or <strong>Class C</strong>, and if it is
<strong>Class B</strong> or <strong>Class C</strong>, the certificate
will also prove the <strong>flashpoint</strong>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>20. Right to Require Re-Test</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>If the owner of the petroleum (or their agent) is not satisfied
with the results of a test, they can ask for a <strong>re-test</strong>
within <strong>seven days</strong> of receiving the test
result.</p></li>
<li><p>To do this, the owner or their agent must apply to the officer
(appointed under <strong>Section 14</strong>) and pay the required fee.
Fresh samples of the petroleum will be taken and tested in the presence
of the owner, their agent, or a person they choose to represent
them.</p></li>
<li><p>If the re-test shows that the original test was wrong, the
testing officer will:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Cancel the original certificate issued under <strong>Section
19</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Issue a new certificate with the correct results.</p></li>
<li><p>Provide a <strong>free certified copy</strong> of the new
certificate to the owner or their agent.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>21. Power to Make Rules Regarding Tests</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>Central Government</strong> can create rules about the
following:</p>
<ol type="1">

<ul>
<li><p>Setting the format for certificates of petroleum tests and
deciding the fees for issuing them.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Handling Doubts About Petroleum Quality</strong>:</p>
