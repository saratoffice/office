<section>
    <h3>124. Construction of Tanks:</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Tanks for storing petroleum (except well-head tanks) must be made of
            iron or steel, following the standards set by the Indian Standards
            Institution (ISI) or another approved code. If needed, tanks can be
            made from other materials.
        </li>
        <li>
            The tanks must be placed on strong foundations or supports made of
            non-combustible material, following good engineering practices.
        </li>
        <li>
            The height of a tank should not be more than 1.5 times its diameter,
            or 20 meters—whichever is less.
        </li>
        <li>
            There must be an air space in each tank that is at least 5% of its
            total capacity, or as prescribed by the approved code—whichever is
            smaller.

    <h3>125. Protection Against Corrosion:</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Tanks (other than well-head tanks) that are installed on or below the
            ground must be protected against corrosion. This can be done by using
            special coatings, cathodic protection, or other methods approved by
            the licensing authority.
        </li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h3>126. Testing of Tanks:</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>
            After a storage tank is installed, re-installed, or repaired, it must
            be tested for leaks using water pressure before it can be used. This
            test must be done by a qualified person.
        </li>
        <li>
            The water used for the test must not contain any petroleum and should
            not be pumped through the same pipes or pumps used for petroleum
            (unless the licensing authority gives special permission).
        </li>
        <li>
            The person conducting the test must issue a certificate confirming
            the test results. This certificate must be submitted to the licensing
